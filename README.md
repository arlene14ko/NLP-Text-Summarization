## About the Repository

This is a project about developing a Natural language processing model that is able to summarize a full book and get an overview of the main ideas expressed by the author, this can also be able to summarize a text, an article or any link given by the user input. 

The task is to develop an "AI-powered tool" that can be able to "read" the content of any given book and make a summarization of the text. Also, the tool has to be deployed online and connect it with the database where the books are stored. 

This project currently works with the public-domain books from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) a collection of more than 60,000 e-books. The e-book is available in several formats such as HTML, UTF-8, but on this project, it uses the UTF-8 format.

## Repository

**README.md**
  - has all the necessary information regarding the project

**app.py**
  - Flask app containing all the functions for the program to run in flask

**request.py**
  - python program that contains all the function to get request the information about the book and to summarize the book
  - functions include but not limited to:
         - function that will request the url
         - function that will scrape the url
         - function that will summarize the book
         - function that will create the dataframe table
         - function to save the summary as a txt file

**Procfile**
  - Heroku apps include a Procfile that specifies the commands that are executed by the app on startup.
  - This Procfile is used to declare a variety of process types, including: the app's web server.

**requirements.txt**
  - is a txt file used for specifying what python packages are required to run this project

**templates folder**
  - this is where all the html templates are saved
  - this has 4 html files namely:

      1. **home.html**
          - home html file is the starting base of the website


      2. **layout.html**
          - this is where all the imports for the html is located
          - this is also where the NavBar and the Footer is saved so it will be shown on all pages


      3. **summarize.html**
          - this is where the summary option is located
          - it has a tab depending on the type file you want to summarize
                  - Search tab - allows the user to search for a book from the Project Gutenberg ebooks and then an option to summarize that book
                  - Upload tab - allows the user to upload a txt file to summarize
                  - Text tab - allows the user to input a text and then it will summarize that text
                  - Article tab - allows the user to input an article, news, or link and it will summarize that article
                  - Questions tab - allows the user to input a question and the content and it will answer it for you (This is still in Progress..)


      4. **summary.html**
          - this is the page where you will see the summary of the input, either a book, an upload, a text or a link
          - there is also an option to save the summary as a txt.file if you click on the **Save as File** button
          - there is also a Text-to-Speech option, where if you click on **Play** it will read the summary for you, other buttons are **Pause** and **Stop**


**static folder**
  - this is where the logo is saved
  - this is also where the **summary.txt** is saved, which gives the user the option to download the summary as a txt file
      
**demo folder**
  - you can find some txt files in this folder which are actually from news articles, this is only used to demonstrate how the **Upload tab** works

## Libraries Used For This Project


**Hugging Face ðŸ¤— Transformers**  https://huggingface.co/transformers/
  - Hugging Face is an NLP-focused startup with a large open-source community, in particular around the Transformers library. 
  - ðŸ¤— Transformers is a python-based library that exposes an API to use many well-known transformer architectures, such as BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2 or DistilBERT, that obtain state-of-the-art results on a variety of NLP tasks like text classification, information extraction, question answering, and text generation. 
  - Those architectures come pre-trained with several sets of weights. 
  - In this project, transformers pipeline is used to summarize the text


**Flask** https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/
  - Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries
  - In this project, flask is used to create the web dashboard application 



**Pandas** https://pypi.org/project/pandas/
  - Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.
  - In this project, pandas is used convert a list to create a dataframe 


**Requests** https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/
  - Requests is an HTTP library, written in Python, for human beings.
  - In this project, requests is used to send an HTTP request


**BeautifulSoup** https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/
  - Beautiful Soup is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from web pages. It sits atop an HTML or XML parser, providing Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.
  - In this project, Beautiful Soup is used to scrape the Project Gutenberg e-books and also to scrape article links that is provided by the users


**Time** https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html
  - Time module handles time-related tasks.
  - In this project, time is used to calculate the total time the code runs.


**Typing** https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html
  - Typing defines a standard notation for Python function and variable type annotations.
  - In this project, typing is used to help document the code properly.

**Heroku** //www.heroku.com
  - Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.
  - In this project, Heroku is used to deploy the app but due to limited GB since we are only using the free version, it was returning an error that the
