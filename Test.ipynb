       "\n",
       "Mr. Phileas Fogg lived, in 1872, at No. 7, Saville Row, Burlington\n",
       "Gardens, the house in which Sheridan died in 1814.  He was one of the\n",
       "most noticeable members of the Reform Club, though he seemed always to\n",
       "avoid attracting attention; an enigmatical personage, about whom little\n",
       "was known, except that he was a polished man of the world.  People said\n",
       "that he resembled Byron--at least that his head was Byronic; but he was\n",
       "a bearded, tranquil Byron, who might live on a thousand years without\n",
       "growing old.\n",
       "\n",
       "Certainly an Englishman, it was more doubtful whether Phileas Fogg was\n",
       "a Londoner.  He was never seen on 'Change, nor at the Bank, nor in the\n",
       "counting-rooms of the \"City\"; no ships ever came into London docks of\n",
       "which he was the owner; he had no public employment; he had never been\n",
       "entered at any of the Inns of Court, either at the Temple, or Lincoln's\n",
       "Inn, or Gray's Inn; nor had his voice ever resounded in the Court of\n",
       "Chancery, or in the Exchequer, or the Queen's Bench, or the\n",
       "Ecclesiastical Courts.  He certainly was not a manufacturer; nor was he\n",
       "a merchant or a gentleman farmer.  His name was strange to the\n",
       "scientific and learned societies, and he never was known to take part\n",
       "in the sage deliberations of the Royal Institution or the London\n",
       "Institution, the Artisan's Association, or the Institution of Arts and\n",
       "Sciences.  He belonged, in fact, to none of the numerous societies\n",
       "which swarm in the English capital, from the Harmonic to that of the\n",
       "Entomologists, founded mainly for the purpose of abolishing pernicious\n",
       "insects.\n",
       "\n",
       "Phileas Fogg was a member of the Reform, and that was all.\n",
       "\n",
       "The way in which he got admission to this exclusive club was simple\n",
       "enough.\n",
       "\n",
       "He was recommended by the Barings, with whom he had an open credit.\n",
       "His cheques were regularly paid at sight from his account current,\n",
       "which was always flush.\n",
       "\n",
       "Was Phileas Fogg rich?  Undoubtedly.  But those who knew him best could\n",
       "not imagine how he had made his fortune, and Mr. Fogg was the last\n",
       "person to whom to apply for the information.  He was not lavish, nor,\n",
       "on the contrary, avaricious; for, whenever he knew that money was\n",
       "needed for a noble, useful, or benevolent purpose, he supplied it\n",
       "quietly and sometimes anonymously.  He was, in short, the least\n",
       "communicative of men.  He talked very little, and seemed all the more\n",
       "mysterious for his taciturn manner.  His daily habits were quite open\n",
       "to observation; but whatever he did was so exactly the same thing that\n",
       "he had always done before, that the wits of the curious were fairly\n",
       "puzzled.\n",
       "\n",
       "Had he travelled?  It was likely, for no one seemed to know the world\n",
       "more familiarly; there was no spot so secluded that he did not appear\n",
       "to have an intimate acquaintance with it.  He often corrected, with a\n",
       "few clear words, the thousand conjectures advanced by members of the\n",
       "club as to lost and unheard-of travellers, pointing out the true\n",
       "probabilities, and seeming as if gifted with a sort of second sight, so\n",
       "often did events justify his predictions.  He must have travelled\n",
       "everywhere, at least in the spirit.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was at least certain that Phileas Fogg had not absented himself from\n",
       "London for many years.  Those who were honoured by a better\n",
       "acquaintance with him than the rest, declared that nobody could pretend\n",
       "to have ever seen him anywhere else.  His sole pastimes were reading\n",
       "the papers and playing whist.  He often won at this game, which, as a\n",
       "silent one, harmonised with his nature; but his winnings never went\n",
       "into his purse, being reserved as a fund for his charities.  Mr. Fogg\n",
       "played, not to win, but for the sake of playing.  The game was in his\n",
       "eyes a contest, a struggle with a difficulty, yet a motionless,\n",
       "unwearying struggle, congenial to his tastes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Phileas Fogg was not known to have either wife or children, which may\n",
       "happen to the most honest people; either relatives or near friends,\n",
       "which is certainly more unusual.  He lived alone in his house in\n",
       "Saville Row, whither none penetrated.  A single domestic sufficed to\n",
       "serve him.  He breakfasted and dined at the club, at hours\n",
       "mathematically fixed, in the same room, at the same table, never taking\n",
       "his meals with other members, much less bringing a guest with him; and\n",
       "went home at exactly midnight, only to retire at once to bed.  He never\n",
       "used the cosy chambers which the Reform provides for its favoured\n",
       "members.  He passed ten hours out of the twenty-four in Saville Row,\n",
       "either in sleeping or making his toilet.  When he chose to take a walk\n",
       "it was with a regular step in the entrance hall with its mosaic\n",
       "flooring, or in the circular gallery with its dome supported by twenty\n",
       "red porphyry Ionic columns, and illumined by blue painted windows.\n",
       "When he breakfasted or dined all the resources of the club--its\n",
       "kitchens and pantries, its buttery and dairy--aided to crowd his table\n",
       "with their most succulent stores; he was served by the gravest waiters,\n",
       "in dress coats, and shoes with swan-skin soles, who proffered the\n",
       "viands in special porcelain, and on the finest linen; club decanters,\n",
       "of a lost mould, contained his sherry, his port, and his\n",
       "cinnamon-spiced claret; while his beverages were refreshingly cooled\n",
       "with ice, brought at great cost from the American lakes.\n",
       "\n",
       "If to live in this style is to be eccentric, it must be confessed that\n",
       "there is something good in eccentricity.\n",
       "\n",
       "The mansion in Saville Row, though not sumptuous, was exceedingly\n",
       "comfortable.  The habits of its occupant were such as to demand but\n",
       "little from the sole domestic, but Phileas Fogg required him to be\n",
       "almost superhumanly prompt and regular.  On this very 2nd of October he\n",
       "had dismissed James Forster, because that luckless youth had brought\n",
       "him shaving-water at eighty-four degrees Fahrenheit instead of\n",
       "eighty-six; and he was awaiting his successor, who was due at the house\n",
       "between eleven and half-past.\n",
       "\n",
       "Phileas Fogg was seated squarely in his armchair, his feet close\n",
       "together like those of a grenadier on parade, his hands resting on his\n",
       "knees, his body straight, his head erect; he was steadily watching a\n",
       "complicated clock which indicated the hours, the minutes, the seconds,\n",
       "the days, the months, and the years.  At exactly half-past eleven Mr.\n",
       "Fogg would, according to his daily habit, quit Saville Row, and repair\n",
       "to the Reform.\n",
       "\n",
       "A rap at this moment sounded on the door of the cosy apartment where\n",
       "Phileas Fogg was seated, and James Forster, the dismissed servant,\n",
       "appeared.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The new servant,\" said he.\n",
       "\n",
       "A young man of thirty advanced and bowed.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are a Frenchman, I believe,\" asked Phileas Fogg, \"and your name is\n",
       "John?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Jean, if monsieur pleases,\" replied the newcomer, \"Jean Passepartout,\n",
       "a surname which has clung to me because I have a natural aptness for\n",
       "going out of one business into another.  I believe I'm honest,\n",
       "monsieur, but, to be outspoken, I've had several trades.  I've been an\n",
       "itinerant singer, a circus-rider, when I used to vault like Leotard,\n",
       "and dance on a rope like Blondin.  Then I got to be a professor of\n",
       "gymnastics, so as to make better use of my talents; and then I was a\n",
       "sergeant fireman at Paris, and assisted at many a big fire.  But I\n",
       "quitted France five years ago, and, wishing to taste the sweets of\n",
       "domestic life, took service as a valet here in England.  Finding myself\n",
       "out of place, and hearing that Monsieur Phileas Fogg was the most exact\n",
       "and settled gentleman in the United Kingdom, I have come to monsieur in\n",
       "the hope of living with him a tranquil life, and forgetting even the\n",
       "name of Passepartout.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Passepartout suits me,\" responded Mr. Fogg.  \"You are well recommended\n",
       "to me; I hear a good report of you.  You know my conditions?\"\n",
       "\n",

       "Phileas Fogg got up, took his hat in his left hand, put it on his head\n",

       "carefully observing him.  He appeared to be a man about forty years of\n",
       "age, with fine, handsome features, and a tall, well-shaped figure; his\n",
       "hair and whiskers were light, his forehead compact and unwrinkled, his\n",
       "face rather pale, his teeth magnificent.  His countenance possessed in\n",
       "the highest degree what physiognomists call \"repose in action,\" a\n",
       "quality of those who act rather than talk.  Calm and phlegmatic, with a\n",
       "clear eye, Mr. Fogg seemed a perfect type of that English composure\n",
       "which Angelica Kauffmann has so skilfully represented on canvas.  Seen\n",
       "in the various phases of his daily life, he gave the idea of being\n",
       "perfectly well-balanced, as exactly regulated as a Leroy chronometer.\n",
       "Phileas Fogg was, indeed, exactitude personified, and this was betrayed\n",
       "even in the expression of his very hands and feet; for in men, as well\n",
       "as in animals, the limbs themselves are expressive of the passions.\n",
       "\n",
       "He was so exact that he was never in a hurry, was always ready, and was\n",
       "economical alike of his steps and his motions.  He never took one step\n",
       "too many, and always went to his destination by the shortest cut; he\n",
       "made no superfluous gestures, and was never seen to be moved or\n",
       "agitated.  He was the most deliberate person in the world, yet always\n",
       "reached his destination at the exact moment.\n",
       "\n",
       "He lived alone, and, so to speak, outside of every social relation; and\n",
       "as he knew that in this world account must be taken of friction, and\n",
       "that friction retards, he never rubbed against anybody.\n",
       "\n",
       "As for Passepartout, he was a true Parisian of Paris.  Since he had\n",
       "abandoned his own country for England, taking service as a valet, he\n",
       "had in vain searched for a master after his own heart.  Passepartout\n",
       "was by no means one of those pert dunces depicted by Moliere with a\n",
       "bold gaze and a nose held high in the air; he was an honest fellow,\n",
       "with a pleasant face, lips a trifle protruding, soft-mannered and\n",
       "serviceable, with a good round head, such as one likes to see on the\n",
       "shoulders of a friend.  His eyes were blue, his complexion rubicund,\n",
       "his figure almost portly and well-built, his body muscular, and his\n",
       "physical powers fully developed by the exercises of his younger days.\n",
       "His brown hair was somewhat tumbled; for, while the ancient sculptors\n",
       "are said to have known eighteen methods of arranging Minerva's tresses,\n",
       "Passepartout was familiar with but one of dressing his own: three\n",
       "strokes of a large-tooth comb completed his toilet.\n",
       "\n",
       "It would be rash to predict how Passepartout's lively nature would\n",
       "agree with Mr. Fogg.  It was impossible to tell whether the new servant\n",
       "would turn out as absolutely methodical as his master required;\n",
       "experience alone could solve the question.  Passepartout had been a\n",
       "sort of vagrant in his early years, and now yearned for repose; but so\n",
       "far he had failed to find it, though he had already served in ten\n",
       "English houses.  But he could not take root in any of these; with\n",
       "chagrin, he found his masters invariably whimsical and irregular,\n",
       "constantly running about the country, or on the look-out for adventure.\n",
       "His last master, young Lord Longferry, Member of Parliament, after\n",
       "passing his nights in the Haymarket taverns, was too often brought home\n",
       "in the morning on policemen's shoulders.  Passepartout, desirous of\n",
       "respecting the gentleman whom he served, ventured a mild remonstrance\n",
       "on such conduct; which, being ill-received, he took his leave.  Hearing\n",
       "that Mr. Phileas Fogg was looking for a servant, and that his life was\n",
       "one of unbroken regularity, that he neither travelled nor stayed from\n",
       "home overnight, he felt sure that this would be the place he was after.\n",
       "He presented himself, and was accepted, as has been seen.\n",
       "\n",
       "At half-past eleven, then, Passepartout found himself alone in the\n",
       "house in Saville Row.  He began its inspection without delay, scouring\n",
       "it from cellar to garret.  So clean, well-arranged, solemn a mansion\n",
       "pleased him; it seemed to him like a snail's shell, lighted and warmed\n",
       "by gas, which sufficed for both these purposes.  When Passepartout\n",
       "reached the second story he recognised at once the room which he was to\n",
       "inhabit, and he was well satisfied with it.  Electric bells and\n",
       "speaking-tubes afforded communication with the lower stories; while on\n",
       "the mantel stood an electric clock, precisely like that in Mr. Fogg's\n",
       "bedchamber, both beating the same second at the same instant.  \"That's\n",
       "good, that'll do,\" said Passepartout to himself.\n",
       "\n",
       "He suddenly observed, hung over the clock, a card which, upon\n",
       "inspection, proved to be a programme of the daily routine of the house.\n",
       "It comprised all that was required of the servant, from eight in the\n",
       "morning, exactly at which hour Phileas Fogg rose, till half-past\n",
       "eleven, when he left the house for the Reform Club--all the details of\n",
       "service, the tea and toast at twenty-three minutes past eight, the\n",
       "shaving-water at thirty-seven minutes past nine, and the toilet at\n",
       "twenty minutes before ten.  Everything was regulated and foreseen that\n",
       "was to be done from half-past eleven a.m. till midnight, the hour at\n",
       "which the methodical gentleman retired.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Fogg's wardrobe was amply supplied and in the best taste.  Each\n",
       "pair of trousers, coat, and vest bore a number, indicating the time of\n",
       "year and season at which they were in turn to be laid out for wearing;\n",
       "and the same system was applied to the master's shoes.  In short, the\n",
       "house in Saville Row, which must have been a very temple of disorder\n",
       "and unrest under the illustrious but dissipated Sheridan, was cosiness,\n",
       "comfort, and method idealised.  There was no study, nor were there\n",
       "books, which would have been quite useless to Mr. Fogg; for at the\n",
       "Reform two libraries, one of general literature and the other of law\n",
       "and politics, were at his service.  A moderate-sized safe stood in his\n",
       "bedroom, constructed so as to defy fire as well as burglars; but\n",
       "Passepartout found neither arms nor hunting weapons anywhere;\n",
       "everything betrayed the most tranquil and peaceable habits.\n",
       "\n",
       "Having scrutinised the house from top to bottom, he rubbed his hands, a\n",
       "broad smile overspread his features, and he said joyfully, \"This is\n",
       "just what I wanted!  Ah, we shall get on together, Mr. Fogg and I!\n",
       "What a domestic and regular gentleman!  A real machine; well, I don't\n",

       "at once to the dining-room, the nine windows of which open upon a\n",
       "tasteful garden, where the trees were already gilded with an autumn\n",
       "colouring; and took his place at the habitual table, the cover of which\n",

       "a broiled fish with Reading sauce, a scarlet slice of roast beef\n",
       "garnished with mushrooms, a rhubarb and gooseberry tart, and a morsel\n",

       "familiarity with this delicate operation.  The perusal of this paper\n",
       "absorbed Phileas Fogg until a quarter before four, whilst the Standard,\n",
       "his next task, occupied him till the dinner hour.  Dinner passed as\n",

       "robber.  Skilful detectives have been sent to all the principal ports\n",
       "of America and the Continent, and he'll be a clever fellow if he slips\n",
       "through their fingers.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But have you got the robber's description?\" asked Stuart.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"In the first place, he is no robber at all,\" returned Ralph,\n",

       "It was Phileas Fogg, whose head now emerged from behind his newspapers,\n",
       "who made this remark.  He bowed to his friends, and entered into the\n",
       "conversation.  The affair which formed its subject, and which was town\n",
       "talk, had occurred three days before at the Bank of England.  A package\n",
       "of banknotes, to the value of fifty-five thousand pounds, had been\n",
       "taken from the principal cashier's table, that functionary being at the\n",
       "moment engaged in registering the receipt of three shillings and\n",
       "sixpence.  Of course, he could not have his eyes everywhere.  Let it be\n",
       "observed that the Bank of England reposes a touching confidence in the\n",
       "honesty of the public.  There are neither guards nor gratings to\n",
       "protect its treasures; gold, silver, banknotes are freely exposed, at\n",
       "the mercy of the first comer.  A keen observer of English customs\n",
       "relates that, being in one of the rooms of the Bank one day, he had the\n",
       "curiosity to examine a gold ingot weighing some seven or eight pounds.\n",
       "He took it up, scrutinised it, passed it to his neighbour, he to the\n",
       "next man, and so on until the ingot, going from hand to hand, was\n",
       "transferred to the end of a dark entry; nor did it return to its place\n",
       "for half an hour.  Meanwhile, the cashier had not so much as raised his\n",
       "head.  But in the present instance things had not gone so smoothly.\n",
       "The package of notes not being found when five o'clock sounded from the\n",
       "ponderous clock in the \"drawing office,\" the amount was passed to the\n",
       "account of profit and loss.  As soon as the robbery was discovered,\n",
       "picked detectives hastened off to Liverpool, Glasgow, Havre, Suez,\n",
       "Brindisi, New York, and other ports, inspired by the proffered reward\n",
       "of two thousand pounds, and five per cent. on the sum that might be\n",
       "recovered.  Detectives were also charged with narrowly watching those\n",
       "who arrived at or left London by rail, and a judicial examination was\n",
       "at once entered upon.\n",
       "\n",
       "There were real grounds for supposing, as the Daily Telegraph said,\n",
       "that the thief did not belong to a professional band.  On the day of\n",
       "the robbery a well-dressed gentleman of polished manners, and with a\n",
       "well-to-do air, had been observed going to and fro in the paying room\n",
       "where the crime was committed.  A description of him was easily\n",
       "procured and sent to the detectives; and some hopeful spirits, of whom\n",
       "Ralph was one, did not despair of his apprehension.  The papers and\n",
       "clubs were full of the affair, and everywhere people were discussing\n",
       "the probabilities of a successful pursuit; and the Reform Club was\n",
       "especially agitated, several of its members being Bank officials.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ralph would not concede that the work of the detectives was likely to\n",
       "be in vain, for he thought that the prize offered would greatly\n",
       "stimulate their zeal and activity.  But Stuart was far from sharing\n",
       "this confidence; and, as they placed themselves at the whist-table,\n",
       "they continued to argue the matter.  Stuart and Flanagan played\n",
       "together, while Phileas Fogg had Fallentin for his partner.  As the\n",
       "game proceeded the conversation ceased, excepting between the rubbers,\n",
       "when it revived again.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I maintain,\" said Stuart, \"that the chances are in favour of the\n",
       "thief, who must be a shrewd fellow.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, but where can he fly to?\" asked Ralph.  \"No country is safe for\n",

       "\n",
       "\"What do you mean by `once'?  Has the world grown smaller?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Certainly,\" returned Ralph.  \"I agree with Mr. Fogg.  The world has\n",
       "grown smaller, since a man can now go round it ten times more quickly\n",
       "than a hundred years ago.  And that is why the search for this thief\n",
       "will be more likely to succeed.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",

       "But the incredulous Stuart was not convinced, and when the hand was\n",
       "finished, said eagerly: \"You have a strange way, Ralph, of proving that\n",

       "town.  One was the British consul at Suez, who, despite the prophecies\n",
       "of the English Government, and the unfavourable predictions of\n",
       "Stephenson, was in the habit of seeing, from his office window, English\n",
       "ships daily passing to and fro on the great canal, by which the old\n",

       "just now manifesting unmistakable signs of impatience, nervously pacing\n",
       "up and down, and unable to stand still for a moment.  This was Fix, one\n",
       "of the detectives who had been dispatched from England in search of the\n",
       "bank robber; it was his task to narrowly watch every passenger who\n",
       "arrived at Suez, and to follow up all who seemed to be suspicious\n",
       "characters, or bore a resemblance to the description of the criminal,\n",
       "which he had received two days before from the police headquarters at\n",
       "London.  The detective was evidently inspired by the hope of obtaining\n",

       "yards along, extended into the roadstead.  A number of fishing-smacks\n",
       "and coasting boats, some retaining the fantastic fashion of ancient\n",

       "at Suez, so as to reach the Dutch or French colonies in Asia by some\n",
       "other route.  He ought to know that he would not be safe an hour in\n",

       "else.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This observation furnished the detective food for thought, and\n",
       "meanwhile the consul went away to his office.  Fix, left alone, was\n",
       "more impatient than ever, having a presentiment that the robber was on\n",
       "board the Mongolia.  If he had indeed left London intending to reach\n",
       "the New World, he would naturally take the route via India, which was\n",
       "less watched and more difficult to watch than that of the Atlantic.\n",
       "But Fix's reflections were soon interrupted by a succession of sharp\n",
       "whistles, which announced the arrival of the Mongolia.  The porters and\n",
       "fellahs rushed down the quay, and a dozen boats pushed off from the\n",
       "shore to go and meet the steamer.  Soon her gigantic hull appeared\n",
       "passing along between the banks, and eleven o'clock struck as she\n",
       "anchored in the road.  She brought an unusual number of passengers,\n",
       "some of whom remained on deck to scan the picturesque panorama of the\n",
       "town, while the greater part disembarked in the boats, and landed on\n",
       "the quay.\n",
       "\n",
       "Fix took up a position, and carefully examined each face and figure\n",
       "which made its appearance.  Presently one of the passengers, after\n",
       "vigorously pushing his way through the importunate crowd of porters,\n",
       "came up to him and politely asked if he could point out the English\n",
       "consulate, at the same time showing a passport which he wished to have\n",
       "visaed.  Fix instinctively took the passport, and with a rapid glance\n",
       "read the description of its bearer.  An involuntary motion of surprise\n",
       "nearly escaped him, for the description in the passport was identical\n",
       "with that of the bank robber which he had received from Scotland Yard.\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",

       "cease at Bombay.\"\n",

       "After this meeting, Passepartout and Fix got into the habit of chatting\n",
       "together, the latter making it a point to gain the worthy man's\n",
       "confidence.  He frequently offered him a glass of whiskey or pale ale\n",
       "in the steamer bar-room, which Passepartout never failed to accept with\n",
       "graceful alacrity, mentally pronouncing Fix the best of good fellows.\n",

       "Passepartout was ravished to behold this celebrated place, and thought\n",
       "that, with its circular walls and dismantled fort, it looked like an\n",
       "immense coffee-cup and saucer. The following night they passed through\n",
       "the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, which means in Arabic The Bridge of Tears,\n",
       "and the next day they put in at Steamer Point, north-west of Aden\n",
       "harbour, to take in coal.  This matter of fuelling steamers is a\n",
       "serious one at such distances from the coal-mines; it costs the\n",
       "Peninsular Company some eight hundred thousand pounds a year.  In these\n",
       "distant seas, coal is worth three or four pounds sterling a ton.\n",

       "Phileas Fogg's programme; besides, the Mongolia, instead of reaching\n",
       "Aden on the morning of the 15th, when she was due, arrived there on the\n",
       "evening of the 14th, a gain of fifteen hours.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Fogg and his servant went ashore at Aden to have the passport again\n",
       "visaed; Fix, unobserved, followed them.  The visa procured, Mr. Fogg\n",
       "returned on board to resume his former habits; while Passepartout,\n",
       "according to custom, sauntered about among the mixed population of\n",
       "Somalis, Banyans, Parsees, Jews, Arabs, and Europeans who comprise the\n",
       "twenty-five thousand inhabitants of Aden.  He gazed with wonder upon\n",
       "the fortifications which make this place the Gibraltar of the Indian\n",

       "work, two thousand years after the engineers of Solomon.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Very curious, very curious,\" said Passepartout to himself, on\n",
       "returning to the steamer.  \"I see that it is by no means useless to\n",
       "travel, if a man wants to see something new.\"  At six p.m.  the\n",
       "Mongolia slowly moved out of the roadstead, and was soon once more on\n",
       "the Indian Ocean.  She had a hundred and sixty-eight hours in which to\n",
       "reach Bombay, and the sea was favourable, the wind being in the\n",
       "north-west, and all sails aiding the engine.  The steamer rolled but\n",
       "little, the ladies, in fresh toilets, reappeared on deck, and the\n",
       "singing and dancing were resumed.  The trip was being accomplished most\n",
       "successfully, and Passepartout was enchanted with the congenial\n",

       "Fix.  On Sunday, October 20th, towards noon, they came in sight of the\n",
       "Indian coast: two hours later the pilot came on board.  A range of\n",
       "hills lay against the sky in the horizon, and soon the rows of palms\n",
       "which adorn Bombay came distinctly into view.  The steamer entered the\n",

       "up at the quays of Bombay.\n",

       "enter certain Indian temples, and that even the faithful must not go in\n",
       "without first leaving their shoes outside the door.  It may be said\n",

       "whose business called them to the eastern coast.  Passepartout rode in\n",
       "the same carriage with his master, and a third passenger occupied a\n",
       "seat opposite to them.  This was Sir Francis Cromarty, one of Mr.\n",
       "Fogg's whist partners on the Mongolia, now on his way to join his corps\n",
       "at Benares.  Sir Francis was a tall, fair man of fifty, who had greatly\n",
       "distinguished himself in the last Sepoy revolt.  He made India his\n",
       "home, only paying brief visits to England at rare intervals; and was\n",
       "almost as familiar as a native with the customs, history, and character\n",
       "of India and its people.  But Phileas Fogg, who was not travelling, but\n",
       "only describing a circumference, took no pains to inquire into these\n",
       "subjects; he was a solid body, traversing an orbit around the\n",
       "terrestrial globe, according to the laws of rational mechanics.  He was\n",
       "at this moment calculating in his mind the number of hours spent since\n",
       "his departure from London, and, had it been in his nature to make a\n",
       "useless demonstration, would have rubbed his hands for satisfaction.\n",
       "Sir Francis Cromarty had observed the oddity of his travelling\n",
       "companion--although the only opportunity he had for studying him had\n",
       "been while he was dealing the cards, and between two rubbers--and\n",
       "questioned himself whether a human heart really beat beneath this cold\n",
       "exterior, and whether Phileas Fogg had any sense of the beauties of\n",
       "nature.  The brigadier-general was free to mentally confess that, of\n",
       "all the eccentric persons he had ever met, none was comparable to this\n",
       "product of the exact sciences.\n",
       "\n",
       "Phileas Fogg had not concealed from Sir Francis his design of going\n",
       "round the world, nor the circumstances under which he set out; and the\n",
       "general only saw in the wager a useless eccentricity and a lack of\n",
       "sound common sense.  In the way this strange gentleman was going on, he\n",
       "would leave the world without having done any good to himself or\n",
       "anybody else.\n",
       "\n",
       "An hour after leaving Bombay the train had passed the viaducts and the\n",
       "Island of Salcette, and had got into the open country.  At Callyan they\n",
       "reached the junction of the branch line which descends towards\n",
       "south-eastern India by Kandallah and Pounah; and, passing Pauwell, they\n",
       "entered the defiles of the mountains, with their basalt bases, and\n",
       "their summits crowned with thick and verdant forests.  Phileas Fogg and\n",
       "Sir Francis Cromarty exchanged a few words from time to time, and now\n",
       "Sir Francis, reviving the conversation, observed, \"Some years ago, Mr.\n",
       "Fogg, you would have met with a delay at this point which would\n",
       "probably have lost you your wager.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How so, Sir Francis?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Because the railway stopped at the base of these mountains, which the\n",
       "passengers were obliged to cross in palanquins or on ponies to\n",
       "Kandallah, on the other side.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Such a delay would not have deranged my plans in the least,\" said Mr.\n",
       "Fogg.  \"I have constantly foreseen the likelihood of certain obstacles.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But, Mr. Fogg,\" pursued Sir Francis, \"you run the risk of having some\n",
       "difficulty about this worthy fellow's adventure at the pagoda.\"\n",
       "Passepartout, his feet comfortably wrapped in his travelling-blanket,\n",
       "was sound asleep and did not dream that anybody was talking about him.\n",
       "\"The Government is very severe upon that kind of offence.  It takes\n",
       "particular care that the religious customs of the Indians should be\n",
       "respected, and if your servant were caught--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Very well, Sir Francis,\" replied Mr. Fogg; \"if he had been caught he\n",
       "would have been condemned and punished, and then would have quietly\n",
       "returned to Europe.  I don't see how this affair could have delayed his\n",
       "master.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The conversation fell again.  During the night the train left the\n",
       "mountains behind, and passed Nassik, and the next day proceeded over\n",
       "the flat, well-cultivated country of the Khandeish, with its straggling\n",
       "villages, above which rose the minarets of the pagodas.  This fertile\n",
       "territory is watered by numerous small rivers and limpid streams,\n",
       "mostly tributaries of the Godavery.\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout, on waking and looking out, could not realise that he was\n",
       "actually crossing India in a railway train.  The locomotive, guided by\n",
       "an English engineer and fed with English coal, threw out its smoke upon\n",
       "cotton, coffee, nutmeg, clove, and pepper plantations, while the steam\n",
       "curled in spirals around groups of palm-trees, in the midst of which\n",
       "were seen picturesque bungalows, viharis (sort of abandoned\n",
       "monasteries), and marvellous temples enriched by the exhaustless\n",
       "ornamentation of Indian architecture.  Then they came upon vast tracts\n",
       "extending to the horizon, with jungles inhabited by snakes and tigers,\n",
       "which fled at the noise of the train; succeeded by forests penetrated\n",
       "by the railway, and still haunted by elephants which, with pensive\n",
       "eyes, gazed at the train as it passed.  The travellers crossed, beyond\n",
       "Milligaum, the fatal country so often stained with blood by the\n",
       "sectaries of the goddess Kali.  Not far off rose Ellora, with its\n",
       "graceful pagodas, and the famous Aurungabad, capital of the ferocious\n",
       "Aureng-Zeb, now the chief town of one of the detached provinces of the\n",
       "kingdom of the Nizam.  It was thereabouts that Feringhea, the Thuggee\n",
       "chief, king of the stranglers, held his sway.  These ruffians, united\n",
       "by a secret bond, strangled victims of every age in honour of the\n",
       "goddess Death, without ever shedding blood; there was a period when\n",
       "this part of the country could scarcely be travelled over without\n",
       "corpses being found in every direction.  The English Government has\n",
       "succeeded in greatly diminishing these murders, though the Thuggees\n",
       "still exist, and pursue the exercise of their horrible rites.\n",
       "\n",
       "At half-past twelve the train stopped at Burhampoor where Passepartout\n",
       "was able to purchase some Indian slippers, ornamented with false\n",
       "pearls, in which, with evident vanity, he proceeded to encase his feet.\n",
       "The travellers made a hasty breakfast and started off for Assurghur,\n",
       "after skirting for a little the banks of the small river Tapty, which\n",
       "empties into the Gulf of Cambray, near Surat.\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout was now plunged into absorbing reverie.  Up to his arrival\n",
       "at Bombay, he had entertained hopes that their journey would end there;\n",
       "but, now that they were plainly whirling across India at full speed, a\n",
       "sudden change had come over the spirit of his dreams.  His old vagabond\n",
       "nature returned to him; the fantastic ideas of his youth once more took\n",
       "possession of him.  He came to regard his master's project as intended\n",
       "in good earnest, believed in the reality of the bet, and therefore in\n",
       "the tour of the world and the necessity of making it without fail\n",
       "within the designated period.  Already he began to worry about possible\n",
       "delays, and accidents which might happen on the way.  He recognised\n",
       "himself as being personally interested in the wager, and trembled at\n",
       "the thought that he might have been the means of losing it by his\n",
       "unpardonable folly of the night before.  Being much less cool-headed\n",
       "than Mr. Fogg, he was much more restless, counting and recounting the\n",
       "days passed over, uttering maledictions when the train stopped, and\n",
       "accusing it of sluggishness, and mentally blaming Mr. Fogg for not\n",
       "having bribed the engineer.  The worthy fellow was ignorant that, while\n",
       "it was possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer, it could\n",
       "not be done on the railway.\n",
       "\n",
       "The train entered the defiles of the Sutpour Mountains, which separate\n",
       "the Khandeish from Bundelcund, towards evening.  The next day Sir\n",
       "Francis Cromarty asked Passepartout what time it was; to which, on\n",
       "consulting his watch, he replied that it was three in the morning.\n",
       "This famous timepiece, always regulated on the Greenwich meridian,\n",
       "which was now some seventy-seven degrees westward, was at least four\n",
       "hours slow.  Sir Francis corrected Passepartout's time, whereupon the\n",
       "latter made the same remark that he had done to Fix; and upon the\n",
       "general insisting that the watch should be regulated in each new\n",
       "meridian, since he was constantly going eastward, that is in the face\n",
       "of the sun, and therefore the days were shorter by four minutes for\n",
       "each degree gone over, Passepartout obstinately refused to alter his\n",
       "watch, which he kept at London time.  It was an innocent delusion which\n",
       "could harm no one.\n",
       "\n",
       "The train stopped, at eight o'clock, in the midst of a glade some\n",
       "fifteen miles beyond Rothal, where there were several bungalows, and\n",
       "workmen's cabins.  The conductor, passing along the carriages, shouted,\n",
       "\"Passengers will get out here!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Phileas Fogg looked at Sir Francis Cromarty for an explanation; but the\n",
       "general could not tell what meant a halt in the midst of this forest of\n",
       "dates and acacias.\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout, not less surprised, rushed out and speedily returned,\n",
       "crying: \"Monsieur, no more railway!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What do you mean?\" asked Sir Francis.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I mean to say that the train isn't going on.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The general at once stepped out, while Phileas Fogg calmly followed\n",
       "him, and they proceeded together to the conductor.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Where are we?\" asked Sir Francis.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"At the hamlet of Kholby.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do we stop here?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Certainly.  The railway isn't finished.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What! not finished?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No.  There's still a matter of fifty miles to be laid from here to\n",
       "Allahabad, where the line begins again.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But the papers announced the opening of the railway throughout.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What would you have, officer?  The papers were mistaken.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yet you sell tickets from Bombay to Calcutta,\" retorted Sir Francis,\n",
       "who was growing warm.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No doubt,\" replied the conductor; \"but the passengers know that they\n",
       "must provide means of transportation for themselves from Kholby to\n",
       "Allahabad.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir Francis was furious.  Passepartout would willingly have knocked the\n",
       "conductor down, and did not dare to look at his master.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Sir Francis,\" said Mr. Fogg quietly, \"we will, if you please, look\n",
       "about for some means of conveyance to Allahabad.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mr. Fogg, this is a delay greatly to your disadvantage.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, Sir Francis; it was foreseen.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What!  You knew that the way--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not at all; but I knew that some obstacle or other would sooner or\n",
       "later arise on my route.  Nothing, therefore, is lost. I have two days,\n",
       "which I have already gained, to sacrifice.  A steamer leaves Calcutta\n",
       "for Hong Kong at noon, on the 25th.  This is the 22nd, and we shall\n",
       "reach Calcutta in time.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "There was nothing to say to so confident a response.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was but too true that the railway came to a termination at this\n",
       "point.  The papers were like some watches, which have a way of getting\n",
       "too fast, and had been premature in their announcement of the\n",
       "completion of the line.  The greater part of the travellers were aware\n",
       "of this interruption, and, leaving the train, they began to engage such\n",
       "vehicles as the village could provide four-wheeled palkigharis, waggons\n",
       "drawn by zebus, carriages that looked like perambulating pagodas,\n",
       "palanquins, ponies, and what not.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty, after searching the village from end\n",
       "to end, came back without having found anything.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I shall go afoot,\" said Phileas Fogg.\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout, who had now rejoined his master, made a wry grimace, as\n",
       "he thought of his magnificent, but too frail Indian shoes.  Happily he\n",
       "too had been looking about him, and, after a moment's hesitation, said,\n",
       "\"Monsieur, I think I have found a means of conveyance.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"An elephant!  An elephant that belongs to an Indian who lives but a\n",
       "hundred steps from here.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Let's go and see the elephant,\" replied Mr. Fogg.\n",
       "\n",
       "They soon reached a small hut, near which, enclosed within some high\n",
       "palings, was the animal in question.  An Indian came out of the hut,\n",
       "and, at their request, conducted them within the enclosure.  The\n",
       "elephant, which its owner had reared, not for a beast of burden, but\n",
       "for warlike purposes, was half domesticated.  The Indian had begun\n",
       "already, by often irritating him, and feeding him every three months on\n",
       "sugar and butter, to impart to him a ferocity not in his nature, this\n",
       "method being often employed by those who train the Indian elephants for\n",
       "battle.  Happily, however, for Mr. Fogg, the animal's instruction in\n",
       "this direction had not gone far, and the elephant still preserved his\n",
       "natural gentleness.  Kiouni--this was the name of the beast--could\n",
       "doubtless travel rapidly for a long time, and, in default of any other\n",
       "means of conveyance, Mr. Fogg resolved to hire him.  But elephants are\n",
       "far from cheap in India, where they are becoming scarce, the males,\n",
       "which alone are suitable for circus shows, are much sought, especially\n",
       "as but few of them are domesticated.  When therefore Mr. Fogg proposed\n",
       "to the Indian to hire Kiouni, he refused point-blank.  Mr. Fogg\n",
       "persisted, offering the excessive sum of ten pounds an hour for the\n",
       "loan of the beast to Allahabad.  Refused.  Twenty pounds?  Refused\n",
       "also.  Forty pounds?  Still refused.  Passepartout jumped at each\n",
       "advance; but the Indian declined to be tempted.  Yet the offer was an\n",
       "alluring one, for, supposing it took the elephant fifteen hours to\n",
       "reach Allahabad, his owner would receive no less than six hundred\n",
       "pounds sterling.\n",
       "\n",
       "Phileas Fogg, without getting in the least flurried, then proposed to\n",
       "purchase the animal outright, and at first offered a thousand pounds\n",
       "for him.  The Indian, perhaps thinking he was going to make a great\n",
       "bargain, still refused.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir Francis Cromarty took Mr. Fogg aside, and begged him to reflect\n",
       "before he went any further; to which that gentleman replied that he was\n",
       "not in the habit of acting rashly, that a bet of twenty thousand pounds\n",
       "was at stake, that the elephant was absolutely necessary to him, and\n",
       "that he would secure him if he had to pay twenty times his value.\n",
       "Returning to the Indian, whose small, sharp eyes, glistening with\n",
       "avarice, betrayed that with him it was only a question of how great a\n",
       "price he could obtain.  Mr. Fogg offered first twelve hundred, then\n",
       "fifteen hundred, eighteen hundred, two thousand pounds.  Passepartout,\n",
       "usually so rubicund, was fairly white with suspense.\n",
       "\n",
       "At two thousand pounds the Indian yielded.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What a price, good heavens!\" cried Passepartout, \"for an elephant.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "It only remained now to find a guide, which was comparatively easy.  A\n",
       "young Parsee, with an intelligent face, offered his services, which Mr.\n",
       "Fogg accepted, promising so generous a reward as to materially\n",
       "stimulate his zeal.  The elephant was led out and equipped.  The\n",
       "Parsee, who was an accomplished elephant driver, covered his back with\n",
       "a sort of saddle-cloth, and attached to each of his flanks some\n",
       "curiously uncomfortable howdahs.  Phileas Fogg paid the Indian with\n",
       "some banknotes which he extracted from the famous carpet-bag, a\n",
       "proceeding that seemed to deprive poor Passepartout of his vitals.\n",
       "Then he offered to carry Sir Francis to Allahabad, which the brigadier\n",
       "gratefully accepted, as one traveller the more would not be likely to\n",
       "fatigue the gigantic beast.  Provisions were purchased at Kholby, and,\n",
       "while Sir Francis and Mr. Fogg took the howdahs on either side,\n",
       "Passepartout got astride the saddle-cloth between them.  The Parsee\n",
       "perched himself on the elephant's neck, and at nine o'clock they set\n",
       "out from the village, the animal marching off through the dense forest\n",
       "of palms by the shortest cut.\n",

       "In order to shorten the journey, the guide passed to the left of the\n",

       "owing to the capricious turnings of the Vindhia Mountains, did not\n",
       "pursue a straight course.  The Parsee, who was quite familiar with the\n",
       "roads and paths in the district, declared that they would gain twenty\n",
       "miles by striking directly through the forest.\n",
       "\n",
       "Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty, plunged to the neck in the\n",

       "Passepartout, who was mounted on the beast's back, and received the\n",
       "direct force of each concussion as he trod along, he was very careful,\n",
       "in accordance with his master's advice, to keep his tongue from between\n",
       "his teeth, as it would otherwise have been bitten off short.  The\n",
       "worthy fellow bounced from the elephant's neck to his rump, and vaulted\n",
       "like a clown on a spring-board; yet he laughed in the midst of his\n",
       "bouncing, and from time to time took a piece of sugar out of his\n",
       "pocket, and inserted it in Kiouni's trunk, who received it without in\n",
       "the least slackening his regular trot.\n",
       "\n",
       "After two hours the guide stopped the elephant, and gave him an hour\n",
       "for rest, during which Kiouni, after quenching his thirst at a\n",
       "neighbouring spring, set to devouring the branches and shrubs round\n",
       "about him.  Neither Sir Francis nor Mr. Fogg regretted the delay, and\n",
       "both descended with a feeling of relief.  \"Why, he's made of iron!\"\n",
       "exclaimed the general, gazing admiringly on Kiouni.\n",

       "hasty breakfast.\n",

       "dominion over this territory, which is subjected to the influence of\n",
       "rajahs, whom it is almost impossible to reach in their inaccessible\n",

       "him, or set him free?  The estimable beast certainly deserved some\n",
       "consideration.  Should Mr. Fogg choose to make him, Passepartout, a\n",
       "present of Kiouni, he would be very much embarrassed; and these\n",
       "thoughts did not cease worrying him for a long time.\n",
       "\n",
       "The principal chain of the Vindhias was crossed by eight in the\n",
       "evening, and another halt was made on the northern slope, in a ruined\n",
       "bungalow.  They had gone nearly twenty-five miles that day, and an\n",
       "equal distance still separated them from the station of Allahabad.\n",
       "\n",
       "The night was cold.  The Parsee lit a fire in the bungalow with a few\n",
       "dry branches, and the warmth was very grateful, provisions purchased at\n",
       "Kholby sufficed for supper, and the travellers ate ravenously.  The\n",
       "conversation, beginning with a few disconnected phrases, soon gave\n",
       "place to loud and steady snores.  The guide watched Kiouni, who slept\n",
       "standing, bolstering himself against the trunk of a large tree.\n",
       "Nothing occurred during the night to disturb the slumberers, although\n",
       "occasional growls from panthers and chatterings of monkeys broke the\n",
       "silence; the more formidable beasts made no cries or hostile\n",
       "demonstration against the occupants of the bungalow.  Sir Francis slept\n",
       "heavily, like an honest soldier overcome with fatigue.  Passepartout\n",
       "was wrapped in uneasy dreams of the bouncing of the day before.  As for\n",
       "Mr. Fogg, he slumbered as peacefully as if he had been in his serene\n",
       "mansion in Saville Row.\n",
       "\n",
       "The journey was resumed at six in the morning; the guide hoped to reach\n",
       "Allahabad by evening.  In that case, Mr. Fogg would only lose a part of\n",
       "the forty-eight hours saved since the beginning of the tour.  Kiouni,\n",
       "resuming his rapid gait, soon descended the lower spurs of the\n",
       "Vindhias, and towards noon they passed by the village of Kallenger, on\n",
       "the Cani, one of the branches of the Ganges.  The guide avoided\n",
       "inhabited places, thinking it safer to keep the open country, which\n",
       "lies along the first depressions of the basin of the great river.\n",
       "Allahabad was now only twelve miles to the north-east.  They stopped\n",
       "under a clump of bananas, the fruit of which, as healthy as bread and\n",
       "as succulent as cream, was amply partaken of and appreciated.\n",
       "\n",
       "At two o'clock the guide entered a thick forest which extended several\n",
       "miles; he preferred to travel under cover of the woods.  They had not\n",
       "as yet had any unpleasant encounters, and the journey seemed on the\n",
       "point of being successfully accomplished, when the elephant, becoming\n",
       "restless, suddenly stopped.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was then four o'clock.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What's the matter?\" asked Sir Francis, putting out his head.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I don't know, officer,\" replied the Parsee, listening attentively to a\n",
       "confused murmur which came through the thick branches.\n",
       "\n",
       "The murmur soon became more distinct; it now seemed like a distant\n",
       "concert of human voices accompanied by brass instruments.  Passepartout\n",
       "was all eyes and ears.  Mr. Fogg patiently waited without a word.  The\n",
       "Parsee jumped to the ground, fastened the elephant to a tree, and\n",
       "plunged into the thicket.  He soon returned, saying:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"A procession of Brahmins is coming this way.  We must prevent their\n",
       "seeing us, if possible.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The guide unloosed the elephant and led him into a thicket, at the same\n",
       "time asking the travellers not to stir.  He held himself ready to\n",
       "bestride the animal at a moment's notice, should flight become\n",
       "necessary; but he evidently thought that the procession of the faithful\n",
       "would pass without perceiving them amid the thick foliage, in which\n",
       "they were wholly concealed.\n",
       "\n",
       "The discordant tones of the voices and instruments drew nearer, and now\n",
       "droning songs mingled with the sound of the tambourines and cymbals.\n",
       "The head of the procession soon appeared beneath the trees, a hundred\n",
       "paces away; and the strange figures who performed the religious\n",
       "ceremony were easily distinguished through the branches.  First came\n",
       "the priests, with mitres on their heads, and clothed in long lace\n",
       "robes.  They were surrounded by men, women, and children, who sang a\n",
       "kind of lugubrious psalm, interrupted at regular intervals by the\n",
       "tambourines and cymbals; while behind them was drawn a car with large\n",
       "wheels, the spokes of which represented serpents entwined with each\n",
       "other.  Upon the car, which was drawn by four richly caparisoned zebus,\n",
       "stood a hideous statue with four arms, the body coloured a dull red,\n",
       "with haggard eyes, dishevelled hair, protruding tongue, and lips tinted\n",
       "with betel.  It stood upright upon the figure of a prostrate and\n",
       "headless giant.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir Francis, recognising the statue, whispered, \"The goddess Kali; the\n",
       "goddess of love and death.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Of death, perhaps,\" muttered back Passepartout, \"but of love--that\n",
       "ugly old hag?  Never!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The Parsee made a motion to keep silence.\n",
       "\n",
       "A group of old fakirs were capering and making a wild ado round the\n",
       "statue; these were striped with ochre, and covered with cuts whence\n",
       "their blood issued drop by drop--stupid fanatics, who, in the great\n",
       "Indian ceremonies, still throw themselves under the wheels of\n",
       "Juggernaut.  Some Brahmins, clad in all the sumptuousness of Oriental\n",
       "apparel, and leading a woman who faltered at every step, followed.\n",
       "This woman was young, and as fair as a European.  Her head and neck,\n",
       "shoulders, ears, arms, hands, and toes were loaded down with jewels and\n",
       "gems with bracelets, earrings, and rings; while a tunic bordered with\n",
       "gold, and covered with a light muslin robe, betrayed the outline of her\n",
       "form.\n",
       "\n",
       "The guards who followed the young woman presented a violent contrast to\n",
       "her, armed as they were with naked sabres hung at their waists, and\n",
       "long damascened pistols, and bearing a corpse on a palanquin.  It was\n",
       "the body of an old man, gorgeously arrayed in the habiliments of a\n",
       "rajah, wearing, as in life, a turban embroidered with pearls, a robe of\n",
       "tissue of silk and gold, a scarf of cashmere sewed with diamonds, and\n",
       "the magnificent weapons of a Hindoo prince.  Next came the musicians\n",
       "and a rearguard of capering fakirs, whose cries sometimes drowned the\n",
       "noise of the instruments; these closed the procession.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir Francis watched the procession with a sad countenance, and, turning\n",
       "to the guide, said, \"A suttee.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The Parsee nodded, and put his finger to his lips.  The procession\n",
       "slowly wound under the trees, and soon its last ranks disappeared in\n",
       "the depths of the wood.  The songs gradually died away; occasionally\n",
       "cries were heard in the distance, until at last all was silence again.\n",
       "\n",
       "Phileas Fogg had heard what Sir Francis said, and, as soon as the\n",
       "procession had disappeared, asked: \"What is a suttee?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"A suttee,\" returned the general, \"is a human sacrifice, but a\n",
       "voluntary one.  The woman you have just seen will be burned to-morrow\n",
       "at the dawn of day.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, the scoundrels!\" cried Passepartout, who could not repress his\n",
       "indignation.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And the corpse?\" asked Mr. Fogg.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Is that of the prince, her husband,\" said the guide; \"an independent\n",
       "rajah of Bundelcund.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Is it possible,\" resumed Phileas Fogg, his voice betraying not the\n",
       "least emotion, \"that these barbarous customs still exist in India, and\n",
       "that the English have been unable to put a stop to them?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"These sacrifices do not occur in the larger portion of India,\" replied\n",
       "Sir Francis; \"but we have no power over these savage territories, and\n",
       "especially here in Bundelcund.  The whole district north of the\n",
       "Vindhias is the theatre of incessant murders and pillage.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The poor wretch!\" exclaimed Passepartout, \"to be burned alive!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes,\" returned Sir Francis, \"burned alive.  And, if she were not, you\n",
       "cannot conceive what treatment she would be obliged to submit to from\n",
       "her relatives.  They would shave off her hair, feed her on a scanty\n",
       "allowance of rice, treat her with contempt; she would be looked upon as\n",
       "an unclean creature, and would die in some corner, like a scurvy dog.\n",
       "The prospect of so frightful an existence drives these poor creatures\n",
       "to the sacrifice much more than love or religious fanaticism.\n",
       "Sometimes, however, the sacrifice is really voluntary, and it requires\n",
       "the active interference of the Government to prevent it.  Several years\n",
       "ago, when I was living at Bombay, a young widow asked permission of the\n",
       "governor to be burned along with her husband's body; but, as you may\n",
       "imagine, he refused.  The woman left the town, took refuge with an\n",
       "independent rajah, and there carried out her self-devoted purpose.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "While Sir Francis was speaking, the guide shook his head several times,\n",
       "and now said: \"The sacrifice which will take place to-morrow at dawn is\n",
       "not a voluntary one.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How do you know?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Everybody knows about this affair in Bundelcund.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But the wretched creature did not seem to be making any resistance,\"\n",
       "observed Sir Francis.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That was because they had intoxicated her with fumes of hemp and\n",
       "opium.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But where are they taking her?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"To the pagoda of Pillaji, two miles from here; she will pass the night\n",
       "there.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And the sacrifice will take place--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"To-morrow, at the first light of dawn.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The guide now led the elephant out of the thicket, and leaped upon his\n",
       "neck.  Just at the moment that he was about to urge Kiouni forward with\n",
       "a peculiar whistle, Mr. Fogg stopped him, and, turning to Sir Francis\n",
       "Cromarty, said, \"Suppose we save this woman.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Save the woman, Mr. Fogg!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have yet twelve hours to spare; I can devote them to that.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why, you are a man of heart!\"\n",
       "\n",

       "IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT RECEIVES A NEW PROOF THAT FORTUNE FAVORS THE BRAVE\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "The project was a bold one, full of difficulty, perhaps impracticable.\n",
       "Mr. Fogg was going to risk life, or at least liberty, and therefore the\n",
       "success of his tour.  But he did not hesitate, and he found in Sir\n",
       "Francis Cromarty an enthusiastic ally.\n",
       "\n",
       "As for Passepartout, he was ready for anything that might be proposed.\n",
       "His master's idea charmed him; he perceived a heart, a soul, under that\n",
       "icy exterior.  He began to love Phileas Fogg.\n",
       "\n",
       "There remained the guide: what course would he adopt?  Would he not\n",
       "take part with the Indians?  In default of his assistance, it was\n",
       "necessary to be assured of his neutrality.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir Francis frankly put the question to him.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Officers,\" replied the guide, \"I am a Parsee, and this woman is a\n",
       "Parsee.  Command me as you will.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Excellent!\" said Mr. Fogg.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"However,\" resumed the guide, \"it is certain, not only that we shall\n",
       "risk our lives, but horrible tortures, if we are taken.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That is foreseen,\" replied Mr. Fogg.  \"I think we must wait till night\n",
       "before acting.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I think so,\" said the guide.\n",

       "The worthy Indian then gave some account of the victim, who, he said,\n",
       "was a celebrated beauty of the Parsee race, and the daughter of a\n",
       "wealthy Bombay merchant.  She had received a thoroughly English\n",
       "education in that city, and, from her manners and intelligence, would\n",
       "be thought an European.  Her name was Aouda.  Left an orphan, she was\n",
       "married against her will to the old rajah of Bundelcund; and, knowing\n",
       "the fate that awaited her, she escaped, was retaken, and devoted by the\n",
       "rajah's relatives, who had an interest in her death, to the sacrifice\n",
       "from which it seemed she could not escape.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Parsee's narrative only confirmed Mr. Fogg and his companions in\n",
       "their generous design.  It was decided that the guide should direct the\n",
       "elephant towards the pagoda of Pillaji, which he accordingly approached\n",
       "as quickly as possible.  They halted, half an hour afterwards, in a\n",
       "copse, some five hundred feet from the pagoda, where they were well\n",
       "concealed; but they could hear the groans and cries of the fakirs\n",
       "distinctly.\n",
       "\n",
       "They then discussed the means of getting at the victim.  The guide was\n",
       "familiar with the pagoda of Pillaji, in which, as he declared, the\n",
       "young woman was imprisoned.  Could they enter any of its doors while\n",
       "the whole party of Indians was plunged in a drunken sleep, or was it\n",
       "safer to attempt to make a hole in the walls?  This could only be\n",
       "determined at the moment and the place themselves; but it was certain\n",
       "that the abduction must be made that night, and not when, at break of\n",
       "day, the victim was led to her funeral pyre.  Then no human\n",
       "intervention could save her.\n",
       "\n",
       "As soon as night fell, about six o'clock, they decided to make a\n",
       "reconnaissance around the pagoda.  The cries of the fakirs were just\n",
       "ceasing; the Indians were in the act of plunging themselves into the\n",
       "drunkenness caused by liquid opium mingled with hemp, and it might be\n",
       "possible to slip between them to the temple itself.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Parsee, leading the others, noiselessly crept through the wood, and\n",
       "in ten minutes they found themselves on the banks of a small stream,\n",
       "whence, by the light of the rosin torches, they perceived a pyre of\n",
       "wood, on the top of which lay the embalmed body of the rajah, which was\n",
       "to be burned with his wife.  The pagoda, whose minarets loomed above\n",
       "the trees in the deepening dusk, stood a hundred steps away.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Come!\" whispered the guide.\n",
       "\n",
       "He slipped more cautiously than ever through the brush, followed by his\n",
       "companions; the silence around was only broken by the low murmuring of\n",
       "the wind among the branches.\n",
       "\n",
       "Soon the Parsee stopped on the borders of the glade, which was lit up\n",
       "by the torches.  The ground was covered by groups of the Indians,\n",
       "motionless in their drunken sleep; it seemed a battlefield strewn with\n",
       "the dead.  Men, women, and children lay together.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the background, among the trees, the pagoda of Pillaji loomed\n",
       "distinctly.  Much to the guide's disappointment, the guards of the\n",
       "rajah, lighted by torches, were watching at the doors and marching to\n",
       "and fro with naked sabres; probably the priests, too, were watching\n",
       "within.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Parsee, now convinced that it was impossible to force an entrance\n",
       "to the temple, advanced no farther, but led his companions back again.\n",
       "Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty also saw that nothing could be\n",
       "attempted in that direction.  They stopped, and engaged in a whispered\n",
       "colloquy.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is only eight now,\" said the brigadier, \"and these guards may also\n",
       "go to sleep.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is not impossible,\" returned the Parsee.\n",
       "\n",
       "They lay down at the foot of a tree, and waited.\n",
       "\n",
       "The time seemed long; the guide ever and anon left them to take an\n",
       "observation on the edge of the wood, but the guards watched steadily by\n",
       "the glare of the torches, and a dim light crept through the windows of\n",
       "the pagoda.\n",
       "\n",
       "They waited till midnight; but no change took place among the guards,\n",
       "and it became apparent that their yielding to sleep could not be\n",
       "counted on.  The other plan must be carried out; an opening in the\n",
       "walls of the pagoda must be made.  It remained to ascertain whether the\n",
       "priests were watching by the side of their victim as assiduously as\n",
       "were the soldiers at the door.\n",
       "\n",
       "After a last consultation, the guide announced that he was ready for\n",
       "the attempt, and advanced, followed by the others.  They took a\n",
       "roundabout way, so as to get at the pagoda on the rear.  They reached\n",
       "the walls about half-past twelve, without having met anyone; here there\n",
       "was no guard, nor were there either windows or doors.\n",
       "\n",
       "The night was dark.  The moon, on the wane, scarcely left the horizon,\n",
       "and was covered with heavy clouds; the height of the trees deepened the\n",
       "darkness.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was not enough to reach the walls; an opening in them must be\n",
       "accomplished, and to attain this purpose the party only had their\n",
       "pocket-knives.  Happily the temple walls were built of brick and wood,\n",
       "which could be penetrated with little difficulty; after one brick had\n",
       "been taken out, the rest would yield easily.\n",
       "\n",
       "They set noiselessly to work, and the Parsee on one side and\n",
       "Passepartout on the other began to loosen the bricks so as to make an\n",
       "aperture two feet wide.  They were getting on rapidly, when suddenly a\n",
       "cry was heard in the interior of the temple, followed almost instantly\n",
       "by other cries replying from the outside.  Passepartout and the guide\n",
       "stopped.  Had they been heard?  Was the alarm being given?  Common\n",
       "prudence urged them to retire, and they did so, followed by Phileas\n",
       "Fogg and Sir Francis.  They again hid themselves in the wood, and\n",
       "waited till the disturbance, whatever it might be, ceased, holding\n",
       "themselves ready to resume their attempt without delay.  But, awkwardly\n",
       "enough, the guards now appeared at the rear of the temple, and there\n",
       "installed themselves, in readiness to prevent a surprise.\n",
       "\n",
       "It would be difficult to describe the disappointment of the party, thus\n",
       "interrupted in their work.  They could not now reach the victim; how,\n",
       "then, could they save her?  Sir Francis shook his fists, Passepartout\n",
       "was beside himself, and the guide gnashed his teeth with rage.  The\n",
       "tranquil Fogg waited, without betraying any emotion.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We have nothing to do but to go away,\" whispered Sir Francis.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Nothing but to go away,\" echoed the guide.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Stop,\" said Fogg.  \"I am only due at Allahabad tomorrow before noon.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But what can you hope to do?\" asked Sir Francis.  \"In a few hours it\n",
       "will be daylight, and--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The chance which now seems lost may present itself at the last moment.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir Francis would have liked to read Phileas Fogg's eyes.  What was\n",
       "this cool Englishman thinking of?  Was he planning to make a rush for\n",
       "the young woman at the very moment of the sacrifice, and boldly snatch\n",
       "her from her executioners?\n",

       "\n",
       "\"And as a proof,\" added the clerk, \"here are the desecrator's very\n",

       "\n",
       "The confusion of master and man, who had quite forgotten the affair at\n",
       "Bombay, for which they were now detained at Calcutta, may be imagined.\n",

       "authorities dealt very severely with this kind of misdemeanour, he\n",
       "promised them a goodly sum in damages, and sent them forward to\n",
       "Calcutta by the next train.  Owing to the delay caused by the rescue of\n",
       "the young widow, Fix and the priests reached the Indian capital before\n",
       "Mr. Fogg and his servant, the magistrates having been already warned by\n",
       "a dispatch to arrest them should they arrive.  Fix's disappointment\n",
       "when he learned that Phileas Fogg had not made his appearance in\n",
       "Calcutta may be imagined.  He made up his mind that the robber had\n",
       "stopped somewhere on the route and taken refuge in the southern\n",
       "provinces.  For twenty-four hours Fix watched the station with feverish\n",
       "anxiety; at last he was rewarded by seeing Mr. Fogg and Passepartout\n",
       "arrive, accompanied by a young woman, whose presence he was wholly at a\n",
       "loss to explain.  He hastened for a policeman; and this was how the\n",
       "party came to be arrested and brought before Judge Obadiah.\n",
       "\n",
       "Had Passepartout been a little less preoccupied, he would have espied\n",
       "the detective ensconced in a corner of the court-room, watching the\n",
       "proceedings with an interest easily understood; for the warrant had\n",
       "failed to reach him at Calcutta, as it had done at Bombay and Suez.\n",
       "\n",
       "Judge Obadiah had unfortunately caught Passepartout's rash exclamation,\n",
       "which the poor fellow would have given the world to recall.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The facts are admitted?\" asked the judge.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Admitted,\" replied Mr. Fogg, coldly.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Inasmuch,\" resumed the judge, \"as the English law protects equally and\n",
       "sternly the religions of the Indian people, and as the man Passepartout\n",
       "has admitted that he violated the sacred pagoda of Malabar Hill, at\n",
       "Bombay, on the 20th of October, I condemn the said Passepartout to\n",
       "imprisonment for fifteen days and a fine of three hundred pounds.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Three hundred pounds!\" cried Passepartout, startled at the largeness\n",
       "of the sum.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Silence!\" shouted the constable.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And inasmuch,\" continued the judge, \"as it is not proved that the act\n",
       "was not done by the connivance of the master with the servant, and as\n",
       "the master in any case must be held responsible for the acts of his\n",
       "paid servant, I condemn Phileas Fogg to a week's imprisonment and a\n",
       "fine of one hundred and fifty pounds.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Fix rubbed his hands softly with satisfaction; if Phileas Fogg could be\n",
       "detained in Calcutta a week, it would be more than time for the warrant\n",
       "to arrive.  Passepartout was stupefied.  This sentence ruined his\n",
       "master.  A wager of twenty thousand pounds lost, because he, like a\n",
       "precious fool, had gone into that abominable pagoda!\n",
       "\n",
       "Phileas Fogg, as self-composed as if the judgment did not in the least\n",
       "concern him, did not even lift his eyebrows while it was being\n",
       "pronounced.  Just as the clerk was calling the next case, he rose, and\n",
       "said, \"I offer bail.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You have that right,\" returned the judge.\n",
       "\n",
       "Fix's blood ran cold, but he resumed his composure when he heard the\n",
       "judge announce that the bail required for each prisoner would be one\n",
       "thousand pounds.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I will pay it at once,\" said Mr. Fogg, taking a roll of bank-bills\n",
       "from the carpet-bag, which Passepartout had by him, and placing them on\n",
       "the clerk's desk.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"This sum will be restored to you upon your release from prison,\" said\n",
       "the judge.  \"Meanwhile, you are liberated on bail.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Come!\" said Phileas Fogg to his servant.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But let them at least give me back my shoes!\" cried Passepartout\n",
       "angrily.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah, these are pretty dear shoes!\" he muttered, as they were handed to\n",
       "him.  \"More than a thousand pounds apiece; besides, they pinch my feet.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Fogg, offering his arm to Aouda, then departed, followed by the\n",
       "crestfallen Passepartout.  Fix still nourished hopes that the robber\n",
       "would not, after all, leave the two thousand pounds behind him, but\n",
       "would decide to serve out his week in jail, and issued forth on Mr.\n",
       "Fogg's traces.  That gentleman took a carriage, and the party were soon\n",
       "landed on one of the quays.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Rangoon was moored half a mile off in the harbour, its signal of\n",
       "departure hoisted at the mast-head.  Eleven o'clock was striking; Mr.\n",
       "Fogg was an hour in advance of time.  Fix saw them leave the carriage\n",
       "and push off in a boat for the steamer, and stamped his feet with\n",
       "disappointment.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The rascal is off, after all!\" he exclaimed.  \"Two thousand pounds\n",
       "sacrificed!  He's as prodigal as a thief!  I'll follow him to the end\n",
       "of the world if necessary; but, at the rate he is going on, the stolen\n",
       "money will soon be exhausted.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The detective was not far wrong in making this conjecture.  Since\n",
       "leaving London, what with travelling expenses, bribes, the purchase of\n",
       "the elephant, bails, and fines, Mr. Fogg had already spent more than\n",
       "five thousand pounds on the way, and the percentage of the sum\n",
       "recovered from the bank robber promised to the detectives, was rapidly\n",
       "diminishing.\n",

       "\n",
       "The Rangoon--one of the Peninsular and Oriental Company's boats plying\n",
       "in the Chinese and Japanese seas--was a screw steamer, built of iron,\n",
       "weighing about seventeen hundred and seventy tons, and with engines of\n",
       "four hundred horse-power.  She was as fast, but not as well fitted up,\n",
       "as the Mongolia, and Aouda was not as comfortably provided for on board\n",
       "of her as Phileas Fogg could have wished.  However, the trip from\n",
       "Calcutta to Hong Kong only comprised some three thousand five hundred\n",
       "miles, occupying from ten to twelve days, and the young woman was not\n",
       "difficult to please.\n",
       "\n",
       "During the first days of the journey Aouda became better acquainted\n",
       "with her protector, and constantly gave evidence of her deep gratitude\n",
       "for what he had done.  The phlegmatic gentleman listened to her,\n",
       "apparently at least, with coldness, neither his voice nor his manner\n",
       "betraying the slightest emotion; but he seemed to be always on the\n",
       "watch that nothing should be wanting to Aouda's comfort.  He visited\n",
       "her regularly each day at certain hours, not so much to talk himself,\n",
       "as to sit and hear her talk.  He treated her with the strictest\n",
       "politeness, but with the precision of an automaton, the movements of\n",
       "which had been arranged for this purpose.  Aouda did not quite know\n",
       "what to make of him, though Passepartout had given her some hints of\n",
       "his master's eccentricity, and made her smile by telling her of the\n",
       "wager which was sending him round the world.  After all, she owed\n",
       "Phileas Fogg her life, and she always regarded him through the exalting\n",
       "medium of her gratitude.\n",
       "\n",
       "Aouda confirmed the Parsee guide's narrative of her touching history.\n",
       "She did, indeed, belong to the highest of the native races of India.\n",
       "Many of the Parsee merchants have made great fortunes there by dealing\n",
       "in cotton; and one of them, Sir Jametsee Jeejeebhoy, was made a baronet\n",
       "by the English government.  Aouda was a relative of this great man, and\n",
       "it was his cousin, Jeejeeh, whom she hoped to join at Hong Kong.\n",
       "Whether she would find a protector in him she could not tell; but Mr.\n",
       "Fogg essayed to calm her anxieties, and to assure her that everything\n",
       "would be mathematically--he used the very word--arranged.  Aouda\n",
       "fastened her great eyes, \"clear as the sacred lakes of the Himalaya,\"\n",
       "upon him; but the intractable Fogg, as reserved as ever, did not seem\n",
       "at all inclined to throw himself into this lake.\n",
       "\n",
       "The first few days of the voyage passed prosperously, amid favourable\n",
       "weather and propitious winds, and they soon came in sight of the great\n",
       "Andaman, the principal of the islands in the Bay of Bengal, with its\n",
       "picturesque Saddle Peak, two thousand four hundred feet high, looming\n",
       "above the waters.  The steamer passed along near the shores, but the\n",
       "savage Papuans, who are in the lowest scale of humanity, but are not,\n",
       "as has been asserted, cannibals, did not make their appearance.\n",
       "\n",
       "The panorama of the islands, as they steamed by them, was superb.  Vast\n",
       "forests of palms, arecs, bamboo, teakwood, of the gigantic mimosa, and\n",
       "tree-like ferns covered the foreground, while behind, the graceful\n",
       "outlines of the mountains were traced against the sky; and along the\n",
       "coasts swarmed by thousands the precious swallows whose nests furnish a\n",
       "luxurious dish to the tables of the Celestial Empire.  The varied\n",
       "landscape afforded by the Andaman Islands was soon passed, however, and\n",
       "the Rangoon rapidly approached the Straits of Malacca, which gave\n",
       "access to the China seas.\n",
       "\n",
       "What was detective Fix, so unluckily drawn on from country to country,\n",
       "doing all this while?  He had managed to embark on the Rangoon at\n",
       "Calcutta without being seen by Passepartout, after leaving orders that,\n",
       "if the warrant should arrive, it should be forwarded to him at Hong\n",
       "Kong; and he hoped to conceal his presence to the end of the voyage.\n",
       "It would have been difficult to explain why he was on board without\n",
       "awakening Passepartout's suspicions, who thought him still at Bombay.\n",
       "But necessity impelled him, nevertheless, to renew his acquaintance\n",
       "with the worthy servant, as will be seen.\n",
       "\n",
       "All the detective's hopes and wishes were now centred on Hong Kong; for\n",
       "the steamer's stay at Singapore would be too brief to enable him to\n",
       "take any steps there.  The arrest must be made at Hong Kong, or the\n",
       "robber would probably escape him for ever.  Hong Kong was the last\n",
       "English ground on which he would set foot; beyond, China, Japan,\n",
       "America offered to Fogg an almost certain refuge.  If the warrant\n",
       "should at last make its appearance at Hong Kong, Fix could arrest him\n",
       "and give him into the hands of the local police, and there would be no\n",
       "further trouble.  But beyond Hong Kong, a simple warrant would be of no\n",
       "avail; an extradition warrant would be necessary, and that would result\n",
       "in delays and obstacles, of which the rascal would take advantage to\n",
       "elude justice.\n",
       "\n",
       "Fix thought over these probabilities during the long hours which he\n",
       "spent in his cabin, and kept repeating to himself, \"Now, either the\n",
       "warrant will be at Hong Kong, in which case I shall arrest my man, or\n",
       "it will not be there; and this time it is absolutely necessary that I\n",
       "should delay his departure.  I have failed at Bombay, and I have failed\n",
       "at Calcutta; if I fail at Hong Kong, my reputation is lost:  Cost what\n",
       "it may, I must succeed!  But how shall I prevent his departure, if that\n",
       "should turn out to be my last resource?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Fix made up his mind that, if worst came to worst, he would make a\n",
       "confidant of Passepartout, and tell him what kind of a fellow his\n",
       "master really was.  That Passepartout was not Fogg's accomplice, he was\n",
       "very certain.  The servant, enlightened by his disclosure, and afraid\n",
       "of being himself implicated in the crime, would doubtless become an\n",
       "ally of the detective.  But this method was a dangerous one, only to be\n",
       "employed when everything else had failed.  A word from Passepartout to\n",
       "his master would ruin all.  The detective was therefore in a sore\n",
       "strait.  But suddenly a new idea struck him.  The presence of Aouda on\n",
       "the Rangoon, in company with Phileas Fogg, gave him new material for\n",
       "reflection.\n",
       "\n",
       "Who was this woman?  What combination of events had made her Fogg's\n",
       "travelling companion?  They had evidently met somewhere between Bombay\n",
       "and Calcutta; but where?  Had they met accidentally, or had Fogg gone\n",
       "into the interior purposely in quest of this charming damsel?  Fix was\n",
       "fairly puzzled.  He asked himself whether there had not been a wicked\n",
       "elopement; and this idea so impressed itself upon his mind that he\n",
       "determined to make use of the supposed intrigue.  Whether the young\n",
       "woman were married or not, he would be able to create such difficulties\n",
       "for Mr. Fogg at Hong Kong that he could not escape by paying any amount\n",
       "of money.\n",
       "\n",
       "But could he even wait till they reached Hong Kong?  Fogg had an\n",
       "abominable way of jumping from one boat to another, and, before\n",
       "anything could be effected, might get full under way again for Yokohama.\n",
       "\n",
       "Fix decided that he must warn the English authorities, and signal the\n",
       "Rangoon before her arrival.  This was easy to do, since the steamer\n",
       "stopped at Singapore, whence there is a telegraphic wire to Hong Kong.\n",
       "He finally resolved, moreover, before acting more positively, to\n",
       "question Passepartout.  It would not be difficult to make him talk;\n",
       "and, as there was no time to lose, Fix prepared to make himself known.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was now the 30th of October, and on the following day the Rangoon\n",
       "was due at Singapore.\n",
       "\n",
       "Fix emerged from his cabin and went on deck.  Passepartout was\n",
       "promenading up and down in the forward part of the steamer.  The\n",
       "detective rushed forward with every appearance of extreme surprise, and\n",
       "exclaimed, \"You here, on the Rangoon?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What, Monsieur Fix, are you on board?\" returned the really astonished\n",
       "Passepartout, recognising his crony of the Mongolia.  \"Why, I left you\n",
       "at Bombay, and here you are, on the way to Hong Kong!  Are you going\n",
       "round the world too?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, no,\" replied Fix; \"I shall stop at Hong Kong--at least for some\n",
       "days.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Hum!\" said Passepartout, who seemed for an instant perplexed.  \"But\n",
       "how is it I have not seen you on board since we left Calcutta?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, a trifle of sea-sickness--I've been staying in my berth.  The Gulf\n",
       "of Bengal does not agree with me as well as the Indian Ocean.  And how\n",
       "is Mr. Fogg?\"\n",

       "though Fix was reserved, and did not attempt to induce his companion to\n",
       "divulge any more facts concerning Mr. Fogg.  He caught a glimpse of\n",
       "that mysterious gentleman once or twice; but Mr. Fogg usually confined\n",
       "himself to the cabin, where he kept Aouda company, or, according to his\n",
       "inveterate habit, took a hand at whist.\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout began very seriously to conjecture what strange chance\n",
       "kept Fix still on the route that his master was pursuing.  It was\n",
       "really worth considering why this certainly very amiable and complacent\n",
       "person, whom he had first met at Suez, had then encountered on board\n",

       "Passepartout was ready to wager his Indian shoes--which he religiously\n",

       "\n",
       "Passepartout might have cudgelled his brain for a century without\n",

       "around the globe.  But, as it is in human nature to attempt the\n",
       "solution of every mystery, Passepartout suddenly discovered an\n",
       "explanation of Fix's movements, which was in truth far from\n",
       "unreasonable.  Fix, he thought, could only be an agent of Mr. Fogg's\n",
       "friends at the Reform Club, sent to follow him up, and to ascertain\n",
       "that he really went round the world as had been agreed upon.\n",

       "During the afternoon of Wednesday, 30th October, the Rangoon entered\n",
       "the Strait of Malacca, which separates the peninsula of that name from\n",
       "Sumatra.  The mountainous and craggy islets intercepted the beauties of\n",
       "this noble island from the view of the travellers.  The Rangoon weighed\n",
       "anchor at Singapore the next day at four a.m., to receive coal, having\n",
       "gained half a day on the prescribed time of her arrival.  Phileas Fogg\n",
       "noted this gain in his journal, and then, accompanied by Aouda, who\n",
       "betrayed a desire for a walk on shore, disembarked.\n",
       "\n",
       "Fix, who suspected Mr. Fogg's every movement, followed them cautiously,\n",
       "without being himself perceived; while Passepartout, laughing in his\n",
       "sleeve at Fix's manoeuvres, went about his usual errands.\n",
       "\n",
       "The island of Singapore is not imposing in aspect, for there are no\n",
       "mountains; yet its appearance is not without attractions.  It is a park\n",
       "checkered by pleasant highways and avenues.  A handsome carriage, drawn\n",
       "by a sleek pair of New Holland horses, carried Phileas Fogg and Aouda\n",
       "into the midst of rows of palms with brilliant foliage, and of\n",
       "clove-trees, whereof the cloves form the heart of a half-open flower.\n",
       "Pepper plants replaced the prickly hedges of European fields;\n",
       "sago-bushes, large ferns with gorgeous branches, varied the aspect of\n",
       "this tropical clime; while nutmeg-trees in full foliage filled the air\n",
       "with a penetrating perfume.  Agile and grinning bands of monkeys\n",

       "Phileas Fogg hoped to accomplish the journey in six days, so as to be\n",

       "Yokohama, the principal Japanese port.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Rangoon had a large quota of passengers, many of whom disembarked\n",

       "rose almost to a storm, but happily blew from the south-west, and thus\n",
       "aided the steamer's progress.  The captain as often as possible put up\n",

       "time which resulted from this cause, while it nearly drove Passepartout\n",
       "out of his senses, did not seem to affect his master in the least.\n",
       "Passepartout blamed the captain, the engineer, and the crew, and\n",
       "consigned all who were connected with the ship to the land where the\n",
       "pepper grows.  Perhaps the thought of the gas, which was remorselessly\n",

       "\n",
       "This expression rather disturbed Fix, without his knowing why.  Had the\n",
       "Frenchman guessed his real purpose?  He knew not what to think.  But\n",
       "how could Passepartout have discovered that he was a detective?  Yet,\n",
       "in speaking as he did, the man evidently meant more than he expressed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout went still further the next day; he could not hold his\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Mr. Fix,\" said he, in a bantering tone, \"shall we be so unfortunate as\n",
       "to lose you when we get to Hong Kong?\"\n",

       "\"Why,\" responded Fix, a little embarrassed, \"I don't know; perhaps--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah, if you would only go on with us!  An agent of the Peninsular\n",
       "Company, you know, can't stop on the way!  You were only going to\n",
       "Bombay, and here you are in China.  America is not far off, and from\n",
       "America to Europe is only a step.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Fix looked intently at his companion, whose countenance was as serene\n",
       "as possible, and laughed with him.  But Passepartout persisted in\n",
       "chaffing him by asking him if he made much by his present occupation.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, and no,\" returned Fix; \"there is good and bad luck in such\n",
       "things.  But you must understand that I don't travel at my own expense.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, I am quite sure of that!\" cried Passepartout, laughing heartily.\n",
       "\n",
       "Fix, fairly puzzled, descended to his cabin and gave himself up to his\n",
       "reflections.  He was evidently suspected; somehow or other the\n",
       "Frenchman had found out that he was a detective.  But had he told his\n",
       "master?  What part was he playing in all this: was he an accomplice or\n",
       "not?  Was the game, then, up?  Fix spent several hours turning these\n",
       "things over in his mind, sometimes thinking that all was lost, then\n",
       "persuading himself that Fogg was ignorant of his presence, and then\n",
       "undecided what course it was best to take.\n",
       "\n",
       "Nevertheless, he preserved his coolness of mind, and at last resolved\n",
       "to deal plainly with Passepartout.  If he did not find it practicable\n",
       "to arrest Fogg at Hong Kong, and if Fogg made preparations to leave\n",
       "that last foothold of English territory, he, Fix, would tell\n",
       "Passepartout all.  Either the servant was the accomplice of his master,\n",
       "and in this case the master knew of his operations, and he should fail;\n",
       "or else the servant knew nothing about the robbery, and then his\n",
       "interest would be to abandon the robber.\n",
       "\n",
       "Such was the situation between Fix and Passepartout.  Meanwhile Phileas\n",
       "Fogg moved about above them in the most majestic and unconscious\n",
       "indifference.  He was passing methodically in his orbit around the\n",
       "world, regardless of the lesser stars which gravitated around him.  Yet\n",
       "there was near by what the astronomers would call a disturbing star,\n",
       "which might have produced an agitation in this gentleman's heart.  But\n",
       "no! the charms of Aouda failed to act, to Passepartout's great\n",
       "surprise; and the disturbances, if they existed, would have been more\n",
       "difficult to calculate than those of Uranus which led to the discovery\n",
       "of Neptune.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was every day an increasing wonder to Passepartout, who read in\n",
       "Aouda's eyes the depths of her gratitude to his master.  Phileas Fogg,\n",
       "though brave and gallant, must be, he thought, quite heartless.  As to\n",
       "the sentiment which this journey might have awakened in him, there was\n",
       "clearly no trace of such a thing; while poor Passepartout existed in\n",
       "perpetual reveries.\n",
       "\n",
       "One day he was leaning on the railing of the engine-room, and was\n",
       "observing the engine, when a sudden pitch of the steamer threw the\n",
       "screw out of the water.  The steam came hissing out of the valves; and\n",
       "this made Passepartout indignant.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The valves are not sufficiently charged!\" he exclaimed.  \"We are not\n",
       "going.  Oh, these English!  If this was an American craft, we should\n",

       "were a part of his programme, and had been foreseen.  Aouda was amazed\n",
       "to find him as calm as he had been from the first time she saw him.\n",

       "Poor fellow!  Fix carefully concealed from him his own satisfaction,\n",
       "for, had he betrayed it, Passepartout could scarcely have restrained\n",

       "unable to remain quiet below, and taking it into his head to aid the\n",
       "progress of the ship by lending a hand with the crew.  He overwhelmed\n",
       "the captain, officers, and sailors, who could not help laughing at his\n",
       "impatience, with all sorts of questions.  He wanted to know exactly how\n",
       "long the storm was going to last; whereupon he was referred to the\n",
       "barometer, which seemed to have no intention of rising.  Passepartout\n",

       "amount of one million four hundred thousand pounds--thousands devoted\n",
       "to one of the most despicable vices which afflict humanity!  The\n",

       "victims cannot dispense with it, except by suffering horrible bodily\n",
       "contortions and agonies.  A great smoker can smoke as many as eight\n",
       "pipes a day; but he dies in five years.  It was in one of these dens\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "Fix pushed Passepartout back in his chair, and resumed: \"Fifty-five\n",

       "\n",
       "\"What do you mean?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I mean that it is a piece of shameful trickery.  They might as well\n",

       "\n",
       "\"That's just what we count on doing.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It's a conspiracy, then,\" cried Passepartout, who became more and more\n",
       "excited as the liquor mounted in his head, for he drank without\n",
       "perceiving it.  \"A real conspiracy!  And gentlemen, too. Bah!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Fix began to be puzzled.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Members of the Reform Club!\" continued Passepartout.  \"You must know,\n",

       "a wager, he tries to win it fairly!\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Nothing,\" replied Passepartout, again emptying his glass.\n",
       "\n",
       "The detective passed his hand across his forehead, hesitating before he\n",
       "spoke again.  What should he do?  Passepartout's mistake seemed\n",
       "sincere, but it made his design more difficult.  It was evident that\n",

       "to suspect.\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Mr. Fogg's wager,\" resumed Fix, \"is only a pretext, of which you and\n",
       "the gentlemen of the Reform are dupes.  He had a motive for securing\n",
       "your innocent complicity.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But why?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Listen.  On the 28th of last September a robbery of fifty-five\n",
       "thousand pounds was committed at the Bank of England by a person whose\n",
       "description was fortunately secured.  Here is his description; it\n",
       "answers exactly to that of Mr. Phileas Fogg.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What nonsense!\" cried Passepartout, striking the table with his fist.\n",
       "\"My master is the most honourable of men!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How can you tell?  You know scarcely anything about him.  You went\n",
       "into his service the day he came away; and he came away on a foolish\n",
       "pretext, without trunks, and carrying a large amount in banknotes.  And\n",
       "yet you are bold enough to assert that he is an honest man!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, yes,\" repeated the poor fellow, mechanically.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Would you like to be arrested as his accomplice?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout, overcome by what he had heard, held his head between his\n",
       "hands, and did not dare to look at the detective.  Phileas Fogg, the\n",
       "saviour of Aouda, that brave and generous man, a robber!  And yet how\n",
       "many presumptions there were against him!  Passepartout essayed to\n",
       "reject the suspicions which forced themselves upon his mind; he did not\n",
       "wish to believe that his master was guilty.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, what do you want of me?\" said he, at last, with an effort.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"See here,\" replied Fix; \"I have tracked Mr. Fogg to this place, but as\n",
       "yet I have failed to receive the warrant of arrest for which I sent to\n",

       "been, am, in his service; I have seen his generosity and goodness; and\n",
       "I will never betray him--not for all the gold in the world.  I come\n",

       "lay upon the table.  Fix slipped one into Passepartout's hand.  He took\n",
       "it, put it between his lips, lit it, drew several puffs, and his head,\n",
       "becoming heavy under the influence of the narcotic, fell upon the table.\n",

       "While these events were passing at the opium-house, Mr. Fogg,\n",
       "unconscious of the danger he was in of losing the steamer, was quietly\n",
       "escorting Aouda about the streets of the English quarter, making the\n",
       "necessary purchases for the long voyage before them.  It was all very\n",
       "well for an Englishman like Mr. Fogg to make the tour of the world with\n",
       "a carpet-bag; a lady could not be expected to travel comfortably under\n",
       "such conditions.  He acquitted his task with characteristic serenity,\n",
       "and invariably replied to the remonstrances of his fair companion, who\n",

       "\n",
       "Had he been capable of being astonished at anything, it would have been\n",
       "not to see his servant return at bedtime.  But, knowing that the\n",
       "steamer was not to leave for Yokohama until the next morning, he did\n",
       "not disturb himself about the matter.  When Passepartout did not appear\n",
       "the next morning to answer his master's bell, Mr. Fogg, not betraying\n",
       "the least vexation, contented himself with taking his carpet-bag,\n",
       "calling Aouda, and sending for a palanquin.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was then eight o'clock; at half-past nine, it being then high tide,\n",
       "the Carnatic would leave the harbour.  Mr. Fogg and Aouda got into the\n",
       "palanquin, their luggage being brought after on a wheelbarrow, and half\n",
       "an hour later stepped upon the quay whence they were to embark.  Mr.\n",
       "Fogg then learned that the Carnatic had sailed the evening before.  He\n",
       "had expected to find not only the steamer, but his domestic, and was\n",
       "forced to give up both; but no sign of disappointment appeared on his\n",
       "face, and he merely remarked to Aouda, \"It is an accident, madam;\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Yes, sir.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"So did I, madam, and I am excessively disappointed.  The Carnatic, its\n",
       "repairs being completed, left Hong Kong twelve hours before the stated\n",
       "time, without any notice being given; and we must now wait a week for\n",
       "another steamer.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "As he said \"a week\" Fix felt his heart leap for joy.  Fogg detained at\n",
       "Hong Kong for a week!  There would be time for the warrant to arrive,\n",
       "and fortune at last favoured the representative of the law.  His horror\n",
       "may be imagined when he heard Mr. Fogg say, in his placid voice, \"But\n",
       "there are other vessels besides the Carnatic, it seems to me, in the\n",
       "harbour of Hong Kong.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "And, offering his arm to Aouda, he directed his steps toward the docks\n",
       "in search of some craft about to start.  Fix, stupefied, followed; it\n",
       "seemed as if he were attached to Mr. Fogg by an invisible thread.\n",
       "Chance, however, appeared really to have abandoned the man it had\n",
       "hitherto served so well.  For three hours Phileas Fogg wandered about\n",
       "the docks, with the determination, if necessary, to charter a vessel to\n",
       "carry him to Yokohama; but he could only find vessels which were\n",
       "loading or unloading, and which could not therefore set sail.  Fix\n",
       "began to hope again.\n",
       "\n",
       "But Mr. Fogg, far from being discouraged, was continuing his search,\n",
       "resolved not to stop if he had to resort to Macao, when he was accosted\n",
       "by a sailor on one of the wharves.\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Does she go fast?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Between eight and nine knots the hour.  Will you look at her?\"\n",

       "\n",
       "\"No.  I have missed the Carnatic, and I must get to Yokohama by the\n",

       "\"Very much so.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The pilot walked away a little distance, and gazed out to sea,\n",
       "evidently struggling between the anxiety to gain a large sum and the\n",

       "Fix ceased to breathe at all.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How?\" asked Mr. Fogg.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"By going to Nagasaki, at the extreme south of Japan, or even to\n",
       "Shanghai, which is only eight hundred miles from here.  In going to\n",
       "Shanghai we should not be forced to sail wide of the Chinese coast,\n",
       "which would be a great advantage, as the currents run northward, and\n",
       "would aid us.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Pilot,\" said Mr. Fogg, \"I must take the American steamer at Yokohama,\n",
       "and not at Shanghai or Nagasaki.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why not?\" returned the pilot.  \"The San Francisco steamer does not\n",
       "start from Yokohama.  It puts in at Yokohama and Nagasaki, but it\n",
       "starts from Shanghai.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are sure of that?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Perfectly.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And when does the boat leave Shanghai?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"On the 11th, at seven in the evening.  We have, therefore, four days\n",
       "before us, that is ninety-six hours; and in that time, if we had good\n",
       "luck and a south-west wind, and the sea was calm, we could make those\n",
       "eight hundred miles to Shanghai.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And you could go--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"In an hour; as soon as provisions could be got aboard and the sails\n",
       "put up.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is a bargain.  Are you the master of the boat?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes; John Bunsby, master of the Tankadere.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Would you like some earnest-money?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If it would not put your honour out--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Here are two hundred pounds on account sir,\" added Phileas Fogg,\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Thanks, sir; I was about to ask the favour.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Very well.  In half an hour we shall go on board.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "servant's disappearance.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I shall do all I can to find him,\" replied Phileas Fogg.\n",
       "\n",
       "While Fix, in a feverish, nervous state, repaired to the pilot-boat,\n",
       "the others directed their course to the police-station at Hong Kong.\n",
       "Phileas Fogg there gave Passepartout's description, and left a sum of\n",
       "money to be spent in the search for him.  The same formalities having\n",
       "been gone through at the French consulate, and the palanquin having\n",
       "stopped at the hotel for the luggage, which had been sent back there,\n",
       "they returned to the wharf.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was now three o'clock; and pilot-boat No. 43, with its crew on\n",
       "board, and its provisions stored away, was ready for departure.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Tankadere was a neat little craft of twenty tons, as gracefully\n",
       "built as if she were a racing yacht.  Her shining copper sheathing, her\n",
       "galvanised iron-work, her deck, white as ivory, betrayed the pride\n",
       "taken by John Bunsby in making her presentable.  Her two masts leaned a\n",
       "trifle backward; she carried brigantine, foresail, storm-jib, and\n",
       "standing-jib, and was well rigged for running before the wind; and she\n",
       "seemed capable of brisk speed, which, indeed, she had already proved by\n",
       "gaining several prizes in pilot-boat races.  The crew of the Tankadere\n",
       "was composed of John Bunsby, the master, and four hardy mariners, who\n",
       "were familiar with the Chinese seas.  John Bunsby, himself, a man of\n",
       "forty-five or thereabouts, vigorous, sunburnt, with a sprightly\n",
       "expression of the eye, and energetic and self-reliant countenance,\n",
       "would have inspired confidence in the most timid.\n",
       "\n",
       "Phileas Fogg and Aouda went on board, where they found Fix already\n",
       "installed.  Below deck was a square cabin, of which the walls bulged\n",
       "out in the form of cots, above a circular divan; in the centre was a\n",
       "table provided with a swinging lamp.  The accommodation was confined,\n",
       "but neat.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am sorry to have nothing better to offer you,\" said Mr. Fogg to Fix,\n",

       "Mr. Fogg and Aouda, who were seated on deck, cast a last glance at the\n",

       "fears lest chance should direct the steps of the unfortunate servant,\n",
       "whom he had so badly treated, in this direction; in which case an\n",
       "explanation the reverse of satisfactory to the detective must have\n",
       "ensued.  But the Frenchman did not appear, and, without doubt, was\n",
       "still lying under the stupefying influence of the opium.\n",
       "\n",
       "John Bunsby, master, at length gave the order to start, and the\n",

       "\n",
       "This voyage of eight hundred miles was a perilous venture on a craft of\n",
       "twenty tons, and at that season of the year.  The Chinese seas are\n",
       "usually boisterous, subject to terrible gales of wind, and especially\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Trust me, your honour.  We are carrying all the sail the wind will let\n",

       "upon the ocean, darkening now with the twilight, on which she had\n",
       "ventured in so frail a vessel.  Above her head rustled the white sails,\n",
       "which seemed like great white wings.  The boat, carried forward by the\n",
       "wind, seemed to be flying in the air.\n",
       "\n",
       "Night came.  The moon was entering her first quarter, and her\n",
       "insufficient light would soon die out in the mist on the horizon.\n",

       "seas crowded with vessels bound landward; for collisions are not\n",
       "uncommon occurrences, and, at the speed she was going, the least shock\n",
       "would shatter the gallant little craft.\n",
       "\n",
       "Fix, seated in the bow, gave himself up to meditation.  He kept apart\n",
       "from his fellow-travellers, knowing Mr. Fogg's taciturn tastes;\n",
       "besides, he did not quite like to talk to the man whose favours he had\n",
       "accepted.  He was thinking, too, of the future.  It seemed certain that\n",
       "Fogg would not stop at Yokohama, but would at once take the boat for\n",
       "San Francisco; and the vast extent of America would ensure him impunity\n",
       "and safety.  Fogg's plan appeared to him the simplest in the world.\n",
       "Instead of sailing directly from England to the United States, like a\n",
       "common villain, he had traversed three quarters of the globe, so as to\n",
       "gain the American continent more surely; and there, after throwing the\n",
       "police off his track, he would quietly enjoy himself with the fortune\n",
       "stolen from the bank.  But, once in the United States, what should he,\n",
       "Fix, do?  Should he abandon this man?  No, a hundred times no!  Until\n",
       "he had secured his extradition, he would not lose sight of him for an\n",
       "hour.  It was his duty, and he would fulfil it to the end.  At all\n",
       "events, there was one thing to be thankful for; Passepartout was not\n",
       "with his master; and it was above all important, after the confidences\n",
       "Fix had imparted to him, that the servant should never have speech with\n",
       "his master.\n",
       "\n",
       "Phileas Fogg was also thinking of Passepartout, who had so strangely\n",
       "disappeared.  Looking at the matter from every point of view, it did\n",
       "not seem to him impossible that, by some mistake, the man might have\n",
       "embarked on the Carnatic at the last moment; and this was also Aouda's\n",
       "opinion, who regretted very much the loss of the worthy fellow to whom\n",
       "she owed so much.  They might then find him at Yokohama; for, if the\n",
       "Carnatic was carrying him thither, it would be easy to ascertain if he\n",
       "had been on board.\n",
       "\n",
       "A brisk breeze arose about ten o'clock; but, though it might have been\n",
       "prudent to take in a reef, the pilot, after carefully examining the\n",
       "heavens, let the craft remain rigged as before.  The Tankadere bore\n",
       "sail admirably, as she drew a great deal of water, and everything was\n",
       "prepared for high speed in case of a gale.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Fogg and Aouda descended into the cabin at midnight, having been\n",
       "already preceded by Fix, who had lain down on one of the cots.  The\n",
       "pilot and crew remained on deck all night.\n",
       "\n",
       "At sunrise the next day, which was 8th November, the boat had made more\n",
       "than one hundred miles.  The log indicated a mean speed of between\n",
       "eight and nine miles.  The Tankadere still carried all sail, and was\n",
       "accomplishing her greatest capacity of speed.  If the wind held as it\n",
       "was, the chances would be in her favour.  During the day she kept along\n",
       "the coast, where the currents were favourable; the coast, irregular in\n",
       "profile, and visible sometimes across the clearings, was at most five\n",
       "miles distant.  The sea was less boisterous, since the wind came off\n",
       "land--a fortunate circumstance for the boat, which would suffer, owing\n",
       "to its small tonnage, by a heavy surge on the sea.\n",
       "\n",
       "The breeze subsided a little towards noon, and set in from the\n",
       "south-west.  The pilot put up his poles, but took them down again\n",
       "within two hours, as the wind freshened up anew.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Fogg and Aouda, happily unaffected by the roughness of the sea, ate\n",
       "with a good appetite, Fix being invited to share their repast, which he\n",
       "accepted with secret chagrin.  To travel at this man's expense and live\n",
       "upon his provisions was not palatable to him.  Still, he was obliged to\n",
       "eat, and so he ate.\n",
       "\n",
       "When the meal was over, he took Mr. Fogg apart, and said, \"sir\"--this\n",
       "\"sir\" scorched his lips, and he had to control himself to avoid\n",
       "collaring this \"gentleman\"--\"sir, you have been very kind to give me a\n",
       "passage on this boat.  But, though my means will not admit of my\n",
       "expending them as freely as you, I must ask to pay my share--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Let us not speak of that, sir,\" replied Mr. Fogg.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But, if I insist--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, sir,\" repeated Mr. Fogg, in a tone which did not admit of a reply.\n",
       "\"This enters into my general expenses.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Fix, as he bowed, had a stifled feeling, and, going forward, where he\n",
       "ensconced himself, did not open his mouth for the rest of the day.\n",
       "\n",
       "Meanwhile they were progressing famously, and John Bunsby was in high\n",
       "hope.  He several times assured Mr. Fogg that they would reach Shanghai\n",
       "in time; to which that gentleman responded that he counted upon it.\n",
       "The crew set to work in good earnest, inspired by the reward to be\n",
       "gained.  There was not a sheet which was not tightened, not a sail which\n",
       "was not vigorously hoisted; not a lurch could be charged to the man at\n",
       "the helm.  They worked as desperately as if they were contesting in a\n",
       "Royal yacht regatta.\n",
       "\n",
       "By evening, the log showed that two hundred and twenty miles had been\n",
       "accomplished from Hong Kong, and Mr. Fogg might hope that he would be\n",
       "able to reach Yokohama without recording any delay in his journal; in\n",
       "which case, the many misadventures which had overtaken him since he\n",
       "left London would not seriously affect his journey.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Tankadere entered the Straits of Fo-Kien, which separate the island\n",
       "of Formosa from the Chinese coast, in the small hours of the night, and\n",
       "crossed the Tropic of Cancer.  The sea was very rough in the straits,\n",
       "full of eddies formed by the counter-currents, and the chopping waves\n",
       "broke her course, whilst it became very difficult to stand on deck.\n",
       "\n",
       "At daybreak the wind began to blow hard again, and the heavens seemed\n",
       "to predict a gale.  The barometer announced a speedy change, the\n",
       "mercury rising and falling capriciously; the sea also, in the\n",
       "south-east, raised long surges which indicated a tempest.  The sun had\n",

       "phosphorescent scintillations of the ocean.\n",
       "\n",
       "John Bunsby long examined the threatening aspect of the heavens,\n",
       "muttering indistinctly between his teeth.  At last he said in a low\n",
       "voice to Mr. Fogg, \"Shall I speak out to your honour?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Of course.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, we are going to have a squall.\"\n",

       "\"South.  Look! a typhoon is coming up.\"\n",

       "\"Glad it's a typhoon from the south, for it will carry us forward.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, if you take it that way,\" said John Bunsby, \"I've nothing more to\n",
       "say.\" John Bunsby's suspicions were confirmed.  At a less advanced\n",
       "season of the year the typhoon, according to a famous meteorologist,\n",
       "would have passed away like a luminous cascade of electric flame; but\n",
       "in the winter equinox it was to be feared that it would burst upon them\n",
       "with great violence.\n",
       "\n",
       "The pilot took his precautions in advance.  He reefed all sail, the\n",
       "pole-masts were dispensed with; all hands went forward to the bows.  A\n",
       "single triangular sail, of strong canvas, was hoisted as a storm-jib,\n",
       "so as to hold the wind from behind.  Then they waited.\n",
       "\n",
       "John Bunsby had requested his passengers to go below; but this\n",
       "imprisonment in so narrow a space, with little air, and the boat\n",
       "bouncing in the gale, was far from pleasant.  Neither Mr. Fogg, Fix,\n",
       "nor Aouda consented to leave the deck.\n",
       "\n",
       "The storm of rain and wind descended upon them towards eight o'clock.\n",
       "With but its bit of sail, the Tankadere was lifted like a feather by a\n",
       "wind, an idea of whose violence can scarcely be given.  To compare her\n",
       "speed to four times that of a locomotive going on full steam would be\n",
       "below the truth.\n",
       "\n",
       "The boat scudded thus northward during the whole day, borne on by\n",
       "monstrous waves, preserving always, fortunately, a speed equal to\n",
       "theirs.  Twenty times she seemed almost to be submerged by these\n",
       "mountains of water which rose behind her; but the adroit management of\n",
       "the pilot saved her.  The passengers were often bathed in spray, but\n",
       "they submitted to it philosophically.  Fix cursed it, no doubt; but\n",
       "Aouda, with her eyes fastened upon her protector, whose coolness amazed\n",
       "her, showed herself worthy of him, and bravely weathered the storm.  As\n",
       "for Phileas Fogg, it seemed just as if the typhoon were a part of his\n",
       "programme.\n",
       "\n",
       "Up to this time the Tankadere had always held her course to the north;\n",
       "but towards evening the wind, veering three quarters, bore down from\n",
       "the north-west.  The boat, now lying in the trough of the waves, shook\n",
       "and rolled terribly; the sea struck her with fearful violence.  At\n",
       "night the tempest increased in violence.  John Bunsby saw the approach\n",
       "of darkness and the rising of the storm with dark misgivings.  He\n",
       "thought awhile, and then asked his crew if it was not time to slacken\n",
       "speed.  After a consultation he approached Mr. Fogg, and said, \"I\n",
       "think, your honour, that we should do well to make for one of the ports\n",
       "on the coast.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I think so too.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah!\" said the pilot.  \"But which one?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I know of but one,\" returned Mr. Fogg tranquilly.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And that is--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Shanghai.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The pilot, at first, did not seem to comprehend; he could scarcely\n",
       "realise so much determination and tenacity.  Then he cried, \"Well--yes!\n",
       "Your honour is right.  To Shanghai!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "So the Tankadere kept steadily on her northward track.\n",
       "\n",
       "The night was really terrible; it would be a miracle if the craft did\n",
       "not founder.  Twice it could have been all over with her if the crew\n",
       "had not been constantly on the watch.  Aouda was exhausted, but did not\n",
       "utter a complaint.  More than once Mr. Fogg rushed to protect her from\n",
       "the violence of the waves.\n",
       "\n",
       "Day reappeared.  The tempest still raged with undiminished fury; but\n",
       "the wind now returned to the south-east.  It was a favourable change,\n",
       "and the Tankadere again bounded forward on this mountainous sea, though\n",
       "the waves crossed each other, and imparted shocks and counter-shocks\n",
       "which would have crushed a craft less solidly built.  From time to time\n",
       "the coast was visible through the broken mist, but no vessel was in\n",
       "sight.  The Tankadere was alone upon the sea.\n",
       "\n",
       "There were some signs of a calm at noon, and these became more distinct\n",
       "as the sun descended toward the horizon.  The tempest had been as brief\n",
       "as terrific.  The passengers, thoroughly exhausted, could now eat a\n",
       "little, and take some repose.\n",
       "\n",
       "The night was comparatively quiet.  Some of the sails were again\n",
       "hoisted, and the speed of the boat was very good.  The next morning at\n",
       "dawn they espied the coast, and John Bunsby was able to assert that\n",
       "they were not one hundred miles from Shanghai.  A hundred miles, and\n",
       "only one day to traverse them!  That very evening Mr. Fogg was due at\n",
       "Shanghai, if he did not wish to miss the steamer to Yokohama.  Had\n",
       "there been no storm, during which several hours were lost, they would\n",
       "be at this moment within thirty miles of their destination.\n",
       "\n",
       "The wind grew decidedly calmer, and happily the sea fell with it.  All\n",
       "sails were now hoisted, and at noon the Tankadere was within forty-five\n",
       "miles of Shanghai.  There remained yet six hours in which to accomplish\n",
       "that distance.  All on board feared that it could not be done, and\n",
       "every one--Phileas Fogg, no doubt, excepted--felt his heart beat with\n",
       "impatience.  The boat must keep up an average of nine miles an hour,\n",
       "and the wind was becoming calmer every moment!  It was a capricious\n",
       "breeze, coming from the coast, and after it passed the sea became\n",
       "smooth.  Still, the Tankadere was so light, and her fine sails caught\n",
       "the fickle zephyrs so well, that, with the aid of the currents John\n",
       "Bunsby found himself at six o'clock not more than ten miles from the\n",
       "mouth of Shanghai River.  Shanghai itself is situated at least twelve\n",
       "miles up the stream.  At seven they were still three miles from\n",
       "Shanghai.  The pilot swore an angry oath; the reward of two hundred\n",
       "pounds was evidently on the point of escaping him.  He looked at Mr.\n",
       "Fogg.  Mr. Fogg was perfectly tranquil; and yet his whole fortune was\n",
       "at this moment at stake.\n",
       "\n",
       "At this moment, also, a long black funnel, crowned with wreaths of\n",
       "smoke, appeared on the edge of the waters.  It was the American\n",
       "steamer, leaving for Yokohama at the appointed time.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Confound her!\" cried John Bunsby, pushing back the rudder with a\n",
       "desperate jerk.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Signal her!\" said Phileas Fogg quietly.\n",
       "\n",
       "A small brass cannon stood on the forward deck of the Tankadere, for\n",
       "making signals in the fogs.  It was loaded to the muzzle; but just as\n",
       "the pilot was about to apply a red-hot coal to the touchhole, Mr. Fogg\n",
       "said, \"Hoist your flag!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The flag was run up at half-mast, and, this being the signal of\n",
       "distress, it was hoped that the American steamer, perceiving it, would\n",
       "change her course a little, so as to succour the pilot-boat.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Fire!\" said Mr. Fogg.  And the booming of the little cannon resounded\n",

       "\n",
       "The next day a passenger with a half-stupefied eye, staggering gait,\n",

       "\n",
       "It was Passepartout; and what had happened to him was as follows:\n",
       "Shortly after Fix left the opium den, two waiters had lifted the\n",
       "unconscious Passepartout, and had carried him to the bed reserved for\n",
       "the smokers.  Three hours later, pursued even in his dreams by a fixed\n",
       "idea, the poor fellow awoke, and struggled against the stupefying\n",
       "influence of the narcotic.  The thought of a duty unfulfilled shook off\n",
       "his torpor, and he hurried from the abode of drunkenness.  Staggering\n",
       "and holding himself up by keeping against the walls, falling down and\n",
       "creeping up again, and irresistibly impelled by a kind of instinct, he\n",
       "kept crying out, \"The Carnatic! the Carnatic!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The steamer lay puffing alongside the quay, on the point of starting.\n",
       "Passepartout had but few steps to go; and, rushing upon the plank, he\n",
       "crossed it, and fell unconscious on the deck, just as the Carnatic was\n",
       "moving off.  Several sailors, who were evidently accustomed to this\n",
       "sort of scene, carried the poor Frenchman down into the second cabin,\n",
       "and Passepartout did not wake until they were one hundred and fifty\n",
       "miles away from China.  Thus he found himself the next morning on the\n",
       "deck of the Carnatic, and eagerly inhaling the exhilarating sea-breeze.\n",
       "The pure air sobered him.  He began to collect his sense, which he\n",
       "found a difficult task; but at last he recalled the events of the\n",
       "evening before, Fix's revelation, and the opium-house.\n",
       "\n",

       "board the Carnatic.  A detective on the track of Mr. Fogg, accused of\n",

       "I am a murderer.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Should he divulge Fix's real errand to his master?  Would it do to tell\n",
       "the part the detective was playing?  Would it not be better to wait\n",
       "until Mr. Fogg reached London again, and then impart to him that an\n",
       "agent of the metropolitan police had been following him round the\n",
       "world, and have a good laugh over it?  No doubt; at least, it was worth\n",
       "considering.  The first thing to do was to find Mr. Fogg, and apologise\n",
       "for his singular behaviour.\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout got up and proceeded, as well as he could with the rolling\n",

       "fault, then, that Mr. Fogg and Aouda had missed the steamer.  Yes, but\n",
       "it was still more the fault of the traitor who, in order to separate\n",
       "him from his master, and detain the latter at Hong Kong, had inveigled\n",
       "him into getting drunk!  He now saw the detective's trick; and at this\n",
       "moment Mr. Fogg was certainly ruined, his bet was lost, and he himself\n",
       "perhaps arrested and imprisoned!  At this thought Passepartout tore his\n",
       "hair.  Ah, if Fix ever came within his reach, what a settling of\n",
       "accounts there would be!\n",
       "\n",
       "After his first depression, Passepartout became calmer, and began to\n",
       "study his situation.  It was certainly not an enviable one.  He found\n",
       "himself on the way to Japan, and what should he do when he got there?\n",
       "His pocket was empty; he had not a solitary shilling, not so much as a\n",
       "penny.  His passage had fortunately been paid for in advance; and he\n",
       "had five or six days in which to decide upon his future course.  He\n",
       "fell to at meals with an appetite, and ate for Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and\n",

       "found himself at first in a thoroughly European quarter, the houses\n",

       "his master; and, before doing so, he determined to exhaust all other\n",
       "means of aid.  As chance did not favour him in the European quarter, he\n",

       "reeds, temples shaded by immense cedar-trees, holy retreats where were\n",
       "sheltered Buddhist priests and sectaries of Confucius, and interminable\n",
       "streets, where a perfect harvest of rose-tinted and red-cheeked\n",
       "children, who looked as if they had been cut out of Japanese screens,\n",

       "hung to their waists; soldiers, clad in blue cotton with white stripes,\n",
       "and bearing guns; the Mikado's guards, enveloped in silken doubles,\n",
       "hauberks and coats of mail; and numbers of military folk of all\n",
       "ranks--for the military profession is as much respected in Japan as it\n",

       "slender legs, short stature, and complexions varying from copper-colour\n",
       "to a dead white, but never yellow, like the Chinese, from whom the\n",
       "Japanese widely differ.  He did not fail to observe the curious\n",
       "equipages--carriages and palanquins, barrows supplied with sails, and\n",
       "litters made of bamboo; nor the women--whom he thought not especially\n",

       "very fine, stringy tobacco.  He went on till he found himself in the\n",
       "fields, in the midst of vast rice plantations.  There he saw dazzling\n",
       "camellias expanding themselves, with flowers which were giving forth\n",
       "their last colours and perfumes, not on bushes, but on trees, and\n",
       "within bamboo enclosures, cherry, plum, and apple trees, which the\n",
       "Japanese cultivate rather for their blossoms than their fruit, and\n",
       "which queerly-fashioned, grinning scarecrows protected from the\n",
       "sparrows, pigeons, ravens, and other voracious birds.  On the branches\n",
       "of the cedars were perched large eagles; amid the foliage of the\n",
       "weeping willows were herons, solemnly standing on one leg; and on every\n",
       "hand were crows, ducks, hawks, wild birds, and a multitude of cranes,\n",

       "walking about all day, the demands of hunger were becoming importunate.\n",
       "He observed that the butchers stalls contained neither mutton, goat,\n",
       "nor pork; and, knowing also that it is a sacrilege to kill cattle,\n",
       "which are preserved solely for farming, he made up his mind that meat\n",
       "was far from plentiful in Yokohama--nor was he mistaken; and, in\n",
       "default of butcher's meat, he could have wished for a quarter of wild\n",
       "boar or deer, a partridge, or some quails, some game or fish, which,\n",
       "with rice, the Japanese eat almost exclusively.  But he found it\n",
       "necessary to keep up a stout heart, and to postpone the meal he craved\n",
       "till the following morning.  Night came, and Passepartout re-entered\n",
       "the native quarter, where he wandered through the streets, lit by\n",
       "vari-coloured lanterns, looking on at the dancers, who were executing\n",
       "skilful steps and boundings, and the astrologers who stood in the open\n",
       "air with their telescopes.  Then he came to the harbour, which was lit\n",

       "that he must get something to eat at all hazards, and the sooner he did\n",
       "so the better.  He might, indeed, sell his watch; but he would have\n",
       "starved first.  Now or never he must use the strong, if not melodious\n",
       "voice which nature had bestowed upon him.  He knew several French and\n",
       "English songs, and resolved to try them upon the Japanese, who must be\n",
       "lovers of music, since they were for ever pounding on their cymbals,\n",
       "tam-tams, and tambourines, and could not but appreciate European talent.\n",

       "It was, perhaps, rather early in the morning to get up a concert, and\n",

       "Passepartout therefore decided to wait several hours; and, as he was\n",
       "sauntering along, it occurred to him that he would seem rather too well\n",
       "dressed for a wandering artist.  The idea struck him to change his\n",
       "garments for clothes more in harmony with his project; by which he\n",
       "might also get a little money to satisfy the immediate cravings of\n",

       "\n",
       "It was only after a long search that Passepartout discovered a native\n",

       "shop accoutred in an old Japanese coat, and a sort of one-sided turban,\n",
       "faded with long use.  A few small pieces of silver, moreover, jingled\n",

       "His first care, after being thus \"Japanesed,\" was to enter a tea-house\n",
       "of modest appearance, and, upon half a bird and a little rice, to\n",
       "breakfast like a man for whom dinner was as yet a problem to be solved.\n",

       "a company of jugglers.\n",

       "This was the Honourable William Batulcar's establishment.  That\n",

       "true but not any better than the Americans do.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"True.  Well, if I can't take you as a servant, I can as a clown.  You\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Humph!  I think so,\" replied Passepartout, recalling the exercises of\n",
       "his younger days.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, that's enough,\" said the Honourable William Batulcar.\n",
       "\n",
       "The engagement was concluded there and then.\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout had at last found something to do.  He was engaged to act\n",
       "in the celebrated Japanese troupe.  It was not a very dignified\n",
       "position, but within a week he would be on his way to San Francisco.\n",
       "\n",
       "The performance, so noisily announced by the Honourable Mr. Batulcar,\n",
       "was to commence at three o'clock, and soon the deafening instruments of\n",
       "a Japanese orchestra resounded at the door.  Passepartout, though he\n",
       "had not been able to study or rehearse a part, was designated to lend\n",
       "the aid of his sturdy shoulders in the great exhibition of the \"human\n",
       "pyramid,\" executed by the Long Noses of the god Tingou.  This \"great\n",
       "attraction\" was to close the performance.\n",
       "\n",
       "Before three o'clock the large shed was invaded by the spectators,\n",
       "comprising Europeans and natives, Chinese and Japanese, men, women and\n",
       "children, who precipitated themselves upon the narrow benches and into\n",
       "the boxes opposite the stage.  The musicians took up a position inside,\n",
       "and were vigorously performing on their gongs, tam-tams, flutes, bones,\n",
       "tambourines, and immense drums.\n",
       "\n",
       "The performance was much like all acrobatic displays; but it must be\n",
       "confessed that the Japanese are the first equilibrists in the world.\n",
       "\n",
       "One, with a fan and some bits of paper, performed the graceful trick of\n",
       "the butterflies and the flowers; another traced in the air, with the\n",
       "odorous smoke of his pipe, a series of blue words, which composed a\n",
       "compliment to the audience; while a third juggled with some lighted\n",
       "candles, which he extinguished successively as they passed his lips,\n",
       "and relit again without interrupting for an instant his juggling.\n",
       "Another reproduced the most singular combinations with a spinning-top;\n",
       "in his hands the revolving tops seemed to be animated with a life of\n",
       "their own in their interminable whirling; they ran over pipe-stems, the\n",
       "edges of sabres, wires and even hairs stretched across the stage; they\n",
       "turned around on the edges of large glasses, crossed bamboo ladders,\n",
       "dispersed into all the corners, and produced strange musical effects by\n",
       "the combination of their various pitches of tone.  The jugglers tossed\n",
       "them in the air, threw them like shuttlecocks with wooden battledores,\n",
       "and yet they kept on spinning; they put them into their pockets, and\n",
       "took them out still whirling as before.\n",
       "\n",
       "It is useless to describe the astonishing performances of the acrobats\n",
       "and gymnasts.  The turning on ladders, poles, balls, barrels, &amp;c., was\n",
       "executed with wonderful precision.\n",
       "\n",
       "But the principal attraction was the exhibition of the Long Noses, a\n",
       "show to which Europe is as yet a stranger.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Long Noses form a peculiar company, under the direct patronage of\n",
       "the god Tingou.  Attired after the fashion of the Middle Ages, they\n",
       "bore upon their shoulders a splendid pair of wings; but what especially\n",
       "distinguished them was the long noses which were fastened to their\n",
       "faces, and the uses which they made of them.  These noses were made of\n",
       "bamboo, and were five, six, and even ten feet long, some straight,\n",
       "others curved, some ribboned, and some having imitation warts upon\n",
       "them.  It was upon these appendages, fixed tightly on their real noses,\n",
       "that they performed their gymnastic exercises.  A dozen of these\n",
       "sectaries of Tingou lay flat upon their backs, while others, dressed to\n",
       "represent lightning-rods, came and frolicked on their noses, jumping\n",
       "from one to another, and performing the most skilful leapings and\n",
       "somersaults.\n",
       "\n",
       "As a last scene, a \"human pyramid\" had been announced, in which fifty\n",
       "Long Noses were to represent the Car of Juggernaut.  But, instead of\n",
       "forming a pyramid by mounting each other's shoulders, the artists were\n",
       "to group themselves on top of the noses.  It happened that the\n",
       "performer who had hitherto formed the base of the Car had quitted the\n",
       "troupe, and as, to fill this part, only strength and adroitness were\n",
       "necessary, Passepartout had been chosen to take his place.\n",
       "\n",
       "The poor fellow really felt sad when--melancholy reminiscence of his\n",
       "youth!--he donned his costume, adorned with vari-coloured wings, and\n",
       "fastened to his natural feature a false nose six feet long.  But he\n",
       "cheered up when he thought that this nose was winning him something to\n",
       "eat.\n",
       "\n",
       "He went upon the stage, and took his place beside the rest who were to\n",
       "compose the base of the Car of Juggernaut.  They all stretched\n",
       "themselves on the floor, their noses pointing to the ceiling.  A second\n",
       "group of artists disposed themselves on these long appendages, then a\n",
       "third above these, then a fourth, until a human monument reaching to\n",
       "the very cornices of the theatre soon arose on top of the noses.  This\n",
       "elicited loud applause, in the midst of which the orchestra was just\n",
       "striking up a deafening air, when the pyramid tottered, the balance was\n",
       "lost, one of the lower noses vanished from the pyramid, and the human\n",
       "monument was shattered like a castle built of cards!\n",
       "\n",
       "It was Passepartout's fault.  Abandoning his position, clearing the\n",
       "footlights without the aid of his wings, and, clambering up to the\n",
       "right-hand gallery, he fell at the feet of one of the spectators,\n",
       "crying, \"Ah, my master! my master!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You here?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Myself.\"\n",

       "\"Very well; then let us go to the steamer, young man!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout passed through the lobby of the\n",
       "theatre to the outside, where they encountered the Honourable Mr.\n",

       "it became necessary to find Passepartout, if possible, without delay.\n",
       "Mr. Fogg applied in vain to the French and English consuls, and, after\n",
       "wandering through the streets a long time, began to despair of finding\n",
       "his missing servant.  Chance, or perhaps a kind of presentiment, at\n",
       "last led him into the Honourable Mr. Batulcar's theatre.  He certainly\n",
       "would not have recognised Passepartout in the eccentric mountebank's\n",
       "costume; but the latter, lying on his back, perceived his master in the\n",

       "taken place on the voyage from Hong Kong to Shanghai on the Tankadere,\n",
       "in company with one Mr. Fix.\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout did not change countenance on hearing this name.  He\n",
       "thought that the time had not yet arrived to divulge to his master what\n",
       "had taken place between the detective and himself; and, in the account\n",
       "he gave of his absence, he simply excused himself for having been\n",
       "overtaken by drunkenness, in smoking opium at a tavern in Hong Kong.\n",

       "furnished his man with funds necessary to obtain clothing more in\n",
       "harmony with his position.  Within an hour the Frenchman had cut off\n",
       "his nose and parted with his wings, and retained nothing about him\n",
       "which recalled the sectary of the god Tingou.\n",
       "\n",
       "The steamer which was about to depart from Yokohama to San Francisco\n",
       "belonged to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, and was named the\n",
       "General Grant.  She was a large paddle-wheel steamer of two thousand\n",
       "five hundred tons; well equipped and very fast.  The massive\n",
       "walking-beam rose and fell above the deck; at one end a piston-rod\n",
       "worked up and down; and at the other was a connecting-rod which, in\n",
       "changing the rectilinear motion to a circular one, was directly\n",
       "connected with the shaft of the paddles.  The General Grant was rigged\n",
       "with three masts, giving a large capacity for sails, and thus\n",
       "materially aiding the steam power.  By making twelve miles an hour, she\n",
       "would cross the ocean in twenty-one days.  Phileas Fogg was therefore\n",
       "justified in hoping that he would reach San Francisco by the 2nd of\n",
       "December, New York by the 11th, and London on the 20th--thus gaining\n",
       "several hours on the fatal date of the 21st of December.\n",
       "\n",
       "There was a full complement of passengers on board, among them English,\n",
       "many Americans, a large number of coolies on their way to California,\n",
       "and several East Indian officers, who were spending their vacation in\n",
       "making the tour of the world.  Nothing of moment happened on the\n",
       "voyage; the steamer, sustained on its large paddles, rolled but little,\n",
       "and the Pacific almost justified its name.  Mr. Fogg was as calm and\n",
       "taciturn as ever.  His young companion felt herself more and more\n",
       "attached to him by other ties than gratitude; his silent but generous\n",
       "nature impressed her more than she thought; and it was almost\n",
       "unconsciously that she yielded to emotions which did not seem to have\n",
       "the least effect upon her protector.  Aouda took the keenest interest\n",
       "in his plans, and became impatient at any incident which seemed likely\n",
       "to retard his journey.\n",
       "\n",
       "She often chatted with Passepartout, who did not fail to perceive the\n",
       "state of the lady's heart; and, being the most faithful of domestics,\n",
       "he never exhausted his eulogies of Phileas Fogg's honesty, generosity,\n",
       "and devotion.  He took pains to calm Aouda's doubts of a successful\n",
       "termination of the journey, telling her that the most difficult part of\n",
       "it had passed, that now they were beyond the fantastic countries of\n",
       "Japan and China, and were fairly on their way to civilised places\n",
       "again.  A railway train from San Francisco to New York, and a\n",
       "transatlantic steamer from New York to Liverpool, would doubtless bring\n",
       "them to the end of this impossible journey round the world within the\n",
       "period agreed upon.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the ninth day after leaving Yokohama, Phileas Fogg had traversed\n",
       "exactly one half of the terrestrial globe.  The General Grant passed,\n",
       "on the 23rd of November, the one hundred and eightieth meridian, and\n",
       "was at the very antipodes of London.  Mr. Fogg had, it is true,\n",
       "exhausted fifty-two of the eighty days in which he was to complete the\n",
       "tour, and there were only twenty-eight left.  But, though he was only\n",
       "half-way by the difference of meridians, he had really gone over\n",
       "two-thirds of the whole journey; for he had been obliged to make long\n",
       "circuits from London to Aden, from Aden to Bombay, from Calcutta to\n",
       "Singapore, and from Singapore to Yokohama.  Could he have followed\n",
       "without deviation the fiftieth parallel, which is that of London, the\n",
       "whole distance would only have been about twelve thousand miles;\n",
       "whereas he would be forced, by the irregular methods of locomotion, to\n",
       "traverse twenty-six thousand, of which he had, on the 23rd of November,\n",
       "accomplished seventeen thousand five hundred.  And now the course was a\n",
       "straight one, and Fix was no longer there to put obstacles in their way!\n",
       "\n",
       "It happened also, on the 23rd of November, that Passepartout made a\n",
       "joyful discovery.  It will be remembered that the obstinate fellow had\n",
       "insisted on keeping his famous family watch at London time, and on\n",
       "regarding that of the countries he had passed through as quite false\n",
       "and unreliable.  Now, on this day, though he had not changed the hands,\n",
       "he found that his watch exactly agreed with the ship's chronometers.\n",
       "His triumph was hilarious.  He would have liked to know what Fix would\n",
       "say if he were aboard!\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The rogue told me a lot of stories,\" repeated Passepartout, \"about the\n",
       "meridians, the sun, and the moon!  Moon, indeed!  moonshine more\n",
       "likely!  If one listened to that sort of people, a pretty sort of time\n",
       "one would keep!  I was sure that the sun would some day regulate itself\n",
       "by my watch!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout was ignorant that, if the face of his watch had been\n",
       "divided into twenty-four hours, like the Italian clocks, he would have\n",
       "no reason for exultation; for the hands of his watch would then,\n",
       "instead of as now indicating nine o'clock in the morning, indicate nine\n",
       "o'clock in the evening, that is, the twenty-first hour after midnight\n",
       "precisely the difference between London time and that of the one\n",
       "hundred and eightieth meridian.  But if Fix had been able to explain\n",
       "this purely physical effect, Passepartout would not have admitted, even\n",
       "if he had comprehended it.  Moreover, if the detective had been on\n",
       "board at that moment, Passepartout would have joined issue with him on\n",
       "a quite different subject, and in an entirely different manner.\n",
       "\n",
       "Where was Fix at that moment?\n",
       "\n",
       "He was actually on board the General Grant.\n",
       "\n",
       "On reaching Yokohama, the detective, leaving Mr. Fogg, whom he expected\n",
       "to meet again during the day, had repaired at once to the English\n",
       "consulate, where he at last found the warrant of arrest.  It had\n",
       "followed him from Bombay, and had come by the Carnatic, on which\n",
       "steamer he himself was supposed to be.  Fix's disappointment may be\n",
       "imagined when he reflected that the warrant was now useless.  Mr. Fogg\n",
       "had left English ground, and it was now necessary to procure his\n",
       "extradition!\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well,\" thought Fix, after a moment of anger, \"my warrant is not good\n",
       "here, but it will be in England.  The rogue evidently intends to return\n",
       "to his own country, thinking he has thrown the police off his track.\n",
       "Good!  I will follow him across the Atlantic.  As for the money, heaven\n",
       "grant there may be some left!  But the fellow has already spent in\n",
       "travelling, rewards, trials, bail, elephants, and all sorts of charges,\n",
       "more than five thousand pounds.  Yet, after all, the Bank is rich!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "His course decided on, he went on board the General Grant, and was\n",
       "there when Mr. Fogg and Aouda arrived.  To his utter amazement, he\n",
       "recognised Passepartout, despite his theatrical disguise.  He quickly\n",
       "concealed himself in his cabin, to avoid an awkward explanation, and\n",
       "hoped--thanks to the number of passengers--to remain unperceived by Mr.\n",
       "Fogg's servant.\n",
       "\n",
       "On that very day, however, he met Passepartout face to face on the\n",
       "forward deck.  The latter, without a word, made a rush for him, grasped\n",
       "him by the throat, and, much to the amusement of a group of Americans,\n",
       "who immediately began to bet on him, administered to the detective a\n",
       "perfect volley of blows, which proved the great superiority of French\n",
       "over English pugilistic skill.\n",
       "\n",
       "When Passepartout had finished, he found himself relieved and\n",
       "comforted.  Fix got up in a somewhat rumpled condition, and, looking at\n",
       "his adversary, coldly said, \"Have you done?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"For this time--yes.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Then let me have a word with you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But I--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"In your master's interests.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout seemed to be vanquished by Fix's coolness, for he quietly\n",
       "followed him, and they sat down aside from the rest of the passengers.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You have given me a thrashing,\" said Fix.  \"Good, I expected it.  Now,\n",
       "listen to me.  Up to this time I have been Mr. Fogg's adversary.  I am\n",
       "now in his game.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Aha!\" cried Passepartout; \"you are convinced he is an honest man?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No,\" replied Fix coldly, \"I think him a rascal.  Sh! don't budge, and\n",
       "let me speak.  As long as Mr. Fogg was on English ground, it was for my\n",
       "interest to detain him there until my warrant of arrest arrived.  I did\n",
       "everything I could to keep him back.  I sent the Bombay priests after\n",
       "him, I got you intoxicated at Hong Kong, I separated you from him, and\n",
       "I made him miss the Yokohama steamer.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout listened, with closed fists.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Now,\" resumed Fix, \"Mr. Fogg seems to be going back to England.  Well,\n",
       "I will follow him there.  But hereafter I will do as much to keep\n",
       "obstacles out of his way as I have done up to this time to put them in\n",
       "his path.  I've changed my game, you see, and simply because it was for\n",
       "my interest to change it.  Your interest is the same as mine; for it is\n",
       "only in England that you will ascertain whether you are in the service\n",
       "of a criminal or an honest man.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout listened very attentively to Fix, and was convinced that\n",
       "he spoke with entire good faith.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Are we friends?\" asked the detective.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Friends?--no,\" replied Passepartout; \"but allies, perhaps.  At the\n",
       "least sign of treason, however, I'll twist your neck for you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Agreed,\" said the detective quietly.\n",
       "\n",
       "Eleven days later, on the 3rd of December, the General Grant entered\n",
       "the bay of the Golden Gate, and reached San Francisco.\n",

       "\n",
       "It was seven in the morning when Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout set\n",
       "foot upon the American continent, if this name can be given to the\n",
       "floating quay upon which they disembarked.  These quays, rising and\n",
       "falling with the tide, thus facilitate the loading and unloading of\n",
       "vessels.  Alongside them were clippers of all sizes, steamers of all\n",
       "nationalities, and the steamboats, with several decks rising one above\n",
       "the other, which ply on the Sacramento and its tributaries.  There were\n",
       "also heaped up the products of a commerce which extends to Mexico,\n",
       "Chili, Peru, Brazil, Europe, Asia, and all the Pacific islands.\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout, in his joy on reaching at last the American continent,\n",
       "thought he would manifest it by executing a perilous vault in fine\n",
       "style; but, tumbling upon some worm-eaten planks, he fell through them.\n",
       "Put out of countenance by the manner in which he thus \"set foot\" upon\n",
       "the New World, he uttered a loud cry, which so frightened the\n",
       "innumerable cormorants and pelicans that are always perched upon these\n",
       "movable quays, that they flew noisily away.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Fogg, on reaching shore, proceeded to find out at what hour the\n",
       "first train left for New York, and learned that this was at six o'clock\n",
       "p.m.; he had, therefore, an entire day to spend in the Californian\n",
       "capital.  Taking a carriage at a charge of three dollars, he and Aouda\n",
       "entered it, while Passepartout mounted the box beside the driver, and\n",
       "they set out for the International Hotel.\n",
       "\n",
       "From his exalted position Passepartout observed with much curiosity the\n",
       "wide streets, the low, evenly ranged houses, the Anglo-Saxon Gothic\n",
       "churches, the great docks, the palatial wooden and brick warehouses,\n",
       "the numerous conveyances, omnibuses, horse-cars, and upon the\n",
       "side-walks, not only Americans and Europeans, but Chinese and Indians.\n",
       "Passepartout was surprised at all he saw.  San Francisco was no longer\n",
       "the legendary city of 1849--a city of banditti, assassins, and\n",
       "incendiaries, who had flocked hither in crowds in pursuit of plunder; a\n",
       "paradise of outlaws, where they gambled with gold-dust, a revolver in\n",
       "one hand and a bowie-knife in the other: it was now a great commercial\n",
       "emporium.\n",
       "\n",
       "The lofty tower of its City Hall overlooked the whole panorama of the\n",
       "streets and avenues, which cut each other at right-angles, and in the\n",
       "midst of which appeared pleasant, verdant squares, while beyond\n",
       "appeared the Chinese quarter, seemingly imported from the Celestial\n",
       "Empire in a toy-box.  Sombreros and red shirts and plumed Indians were\n",
       "rarely to be seen; but there were silk hats and black coats everywhere\n",
       "worn by a multitude of nervously active, gentlemanly-looking men.  Some\n",
       "of the streets--especially Montgomery Street, which is to San Francisco\n",
       "what Regent Street is to London, the Boulevard des Italiens to Paris,\n",
       "and Broadway to New York--were lined with splendid and spacious\n",
       "stores, which exposed in their windows the products of the entire world.\n",
       "\n",
       "When Passepartout reached the International Hotel, it did not seem to\n",
       "him as if he had left England at all.\n",
       "\n",
       "The ground floor of the hotel was occupied by a large bar, a sort of\n",
       "restaurant freely open to all passers-by, who might partake of dried\n",
       "beef, oyster soup, biscuits, and cheese, without taking out their\n",
       "purses.  Payment was made only for the ale, porter, or sherry which was\n",
       "drunk.  This seemed \"very American\" to Passepartout.  The hotel\n",
       "refreshment-rooms were comfortable, and Mr. Fogg and Aouda, installing\n",
       "themselves at a table, were abundantly served on diminutive plates by\n",
       "negroes of darkest hue.\n",
       "\n",
       "After breakfast, Mr. Fogg, accompanied by Aouda, started for the\n",
       "English consulate to have his passport visaed.  As he was going out, he\n",
       "met Passepartout, who asked him if it would not be well, before taking\n",
       "the train, to purchase some dozens of Enfield rifles and Colt's\n",
       "revolvers.  He had been listening to stories of attacks upon the trains\n",
       "by the Sioux and Pawnees.  Mr. Fogg thought it a useless precaution,\n",
       "but told him to do as he thought best, and went on to the consulate.\n",
       "\n",
       "He had not proceeded two hundred steps, however, when, \"by the greatest\n",
       "chance in the world,\" he met Fix.  The detective seemed wholly taken by\n",
       "surprise.  What!  Had Mr. Fogg and himself crossed the Pacific\n",
       "together, and not met on the steamer!  At least Fix felt honoured to\n",
       "behold once more the gentleman to whom he owed so much, and, as his\n",
       "business recalled him to Europe, he should be delighted to continue the\n",
       "journey in such pleasant company.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Fogg replied that the honour would be his; and the detective--who\n",
       "was determined not to lose sight of him--begged permission to accompany\n",
       "them in their walk about San Francisco--a request which Mr. Fogg\n",
       "readily granted.\n",
       "\n",
       "They soon found themselves in Montgomery Street, where a great crowd\n",
       "was collected; the side-walks, street, horsecar rails, the shop-doors,\n",
       "the windows of the houses, and even the roofs, were full of people.\n",
       "Men were going about carrying large posters, and flags and streamers\n",
       "were floating in the wind; while loud cries were heard on every hand.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Hurrah for Camerfield!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Hurrah for Mandiboy!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "It was a political meeting; at least so Fix conjectured, who said to\n",
       "Mr. Fogg, \"Perhaps we had better not mingle with the crowd.  There may\n",
       "be danger in it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes,\" returned Mr. Fogg; \"and blows, even if they are political are\n",
       "still blows.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Fix smiled at this remark; and, in order to be able to see without\n",
       "being jostled about, the party took up a position on the top of a\n",
       "flight of steps situated at the upper end of Montgomery Street.\n",
       "Opposite them, on the other side of the street, between a coal wharf\n",
       "and a petroleum warehouse, a large platform had been erected in the\n",
       "open air, towards which the current of the crowd seemed to be directed.\n",
       "\n",
       "For what purpose was this meeting?  What was the occasion of this\n",
       "excited assemblage?  Phileas Fogg could not imagine.  Was it to\n",
       "nominate some high official--a governor or member of Congress?  It was\n",
       "not improbable, so agitated was the multitude before them.\n",
       "\n",
       "Just at this moment there was an unusual stir in the human mass.  All\n",
       "the hands were raised in the air.  Some, tightly closed, seemed to\n",
       "disappear suddenly in the midst of the cries--an energetic way, no\n",
       "doubt, of casting a vote.  The crowd swayed back, the banners and flags\n",
       "wavered, disappeared an instant, then reappeared in tatters.  The\n",
       "undulations of the human surge reached the steps, while all the heads\n",
       "floundered on the surface like a sea agitated by a squall.  Many of the\n",
       "black hats disappeared, and the greater part of the crowd seemed to\n",
       "have diminished in height.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is evidently a meeting,\" said Fix, \"and its object must be an\n",
       "exciting one.  I should not wonder if it were about the Alabama,\n",
       "despite the fact that that question is settled.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Perhaps,\" replied Mr. Fogg, simply.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"At least, there are two champions in presence of each other, the\n",
       "Honourable Mr. Camerfield and the Honourable Mr. Mandiboy.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Aouda, leaning upon Mr. Fogg's arm, observed the tumultuous scene with\n",
       "surprise, while Fix asked a man near him what the cause of it all was.\n",
       "Before the man could reply, a fresh agitation arose; hurrahs and\n",
       "excited shouts were heard; the staffs of the banners began to be used\n",
       "as offensive weapons; and fists flew about in every direction.  Thumps\n",
       "were exchanged from the tops of the carriages and omnibuses which had\n",
       "been blocked up in the crowd.  Boots and shoes went whirling through\n",
       "the air, and Mr. Fogg thought he even heard the crack of revolvers\n",
       "mingling in the din, the rout approached the stairway, and flowed over\n",
       "the lower step.  One of the parties had evidently been repulsed; but\n",
       "the mere lookers-on could not tell whether Mandiboy or Camerfield had\n",
       "gained the upper hand.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It would be prudent for us to retire,\" said Fix, who was anxious that\n",
       "Mr. Fogg should not receive any injury, at least until they got back to\n",
       "London.  \"If there is any question about England in all this, and we\n",
       "were recognised, I fear it would go hard with us.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"An English subject--\" began Mr. Fogg.\n",
       "\n",
       "He did not finish his sentence; for a terrific hubbub now arose on the\n",
       "terrace behind the flight of steps where they stood, and there were\n",
       "frantic shouts of, \"Hurrah for Mandiboy!  Hip, hip, hurrah!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "It was a band of voters coming to the rescue of their allies, and\n",
       "taking the Camerfield forces in flank.  Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Fix found\n",
       "themselves between two fires; it was too late to escape.  The torrent\n",
       "of men, armed with loaded canes and sticks, was irresistible.  Phileas\n",
       "Fogg and Fix were roughly hustled in their attempts to protect their\n",
       "fair companion; the former, as cool as ever, tried to defend himself\n",
       "with the weapons which nature has placed at the end of every\n",
       "Englishman's arm, but in vain.  A big brawny fellow with a red beard,\n",
       "flushed face, and broad shoulders, who seemed to be the chief of the\n",
       "band, raised his clenched fist to strike Mr. Fogg, whom he would have\n",
       "given a crushing blow, had not Fix rushed in and received it in his\n",
       "stead.  An enormous bruise immediately made its appearance under the\n",
       "detective's silk hat, which was completely smashed in.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yankee!\" exclaimed Mr. Fogg, darting a contemptuous look at the\n",
       "ruffian.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Englishman!\" returned the other.  \"We will meet again!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"When you please.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What is your name?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Phileas Fogg.  And yours?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Colonel Stamp Proctor.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The human tide now swept by, after overturning Fix, who speedily got\n",
       "upon his feet again, though with tattered clothes.  Happily, he was not\n",
       "seriously hurt.  His travelling overcoat was divided into two unequal\n",
       "parts, and his trousers resembled those of certain Indians, which fit\n",
       "less compactly than they are easy to put on.  Aouda had escaped\n",
       "unharmed, and Fix alone bore marks of the fray in his black and blue\n",
       "bruise.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Thanks,\" said Mr. Fogg to the detective, as soon as they were out of\n",
       "the crowd.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No thanks are necessary,\" replied.  Fix; \"but let us go.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Where?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"To a tailor's.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Such a visit was, indeed, opportune.  The clothing of both Mr. Fogg and\n",
       "Fix was in rags, as if they had themselves been actively engaged in the\n",
       "contest between Camerfield and Mandiboy.  An hour after, they were once\n",
       "more suitably attired, and with Aouda returned to the International\n",
       "Hotel.\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout was waiting for his master, armed with half a dozen\n",
       "six-barrelled revolvers.  When he perceived Fix, he knit his brows; but\n",
       "Aouda having, in a few words, told him of their adventure, his\n",
       "countenance resumed its placid expression.  Fix evidently was no longer\n",
       "an enemy, but an ally; he was faithfully keeping his word.\n",
       "\n",
       "Dinner over, the coach which was to convey the passengers and their\n",
       "luggage to the station drew up to the door.  As he was getting in, Mr.\n",
       "Fogg said to Fix, \"You have not seen this Colonel Proctor again?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I will come back to America to find him,\" said Phileas Fogg calmly.\n",
       "\"It would not be right for an Englishman to permit himself to be\n",
       "treated in that way, without retaliating.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The detective smiled, but did not reply.  It was clear that Mr. Fogg\n",
       "was one of those Englishmen who, while they do not tolerate duelling at\n",
       "home, fight abroad when their honour is attacked.\n",
       "\n",
       "At a quarter before six the travellers reached the station, and found\n",
       "the train ready to depart.  As he was about to enter it, Mr. Fogg\n",
       "called a porter, and said to him: \"My friend, was there not some\n",
       "trouble to-day in San Francisco?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It was a political meeting, sir,\" replied the porter.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But I thought there was a great deal of disturbance in the streets.\"\n",

       "form an insurmountable obstacle to the passage of the trains; thousands\n",

       "clear the way with its cow-catcher; but the mass of animals was too\n",
       "great.  The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now\n",
       "and then deafening bellowings.  There was no use of interrupting them,\n",
       "for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can moderate and\n",

       "\n",
       "At the appointed hour Elder William Hitch rose, and, in an irritated\n",
       "voice, as if he had already been contradicted, said, \"I tell you that\n",

       "subjected.  The government had just succeeded, with some difficulty, in\n",
       "reducing these independent fanatics to its rule.  It had made itself\n",
       "master of Utah, and subjected that territory to the laws of the Union,\n",
       "after imprisoning Brigham Young on a charge of rebellion and polygamy.\n",
       "The disciples of the prophet had since redoubled their efforts, and\n",
       "resisted, by words at least, the authority of Congress.  Elder Hitch,\n",
       "as is seen, was trying to make proselytes on the very railway trains.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then, emphasising his words with his loud voice and frequent gestures,\n",
       "he related the history of the Mormons from Biblical times: how that, in\n",
       "Israel, a Mormon prophet of the tribe of Joseph published the annals of\n",
       "the new religion, and bequeathed them to his son Mormon; how, many\n",
       "centuries later, a translation of this precious book, which was written\n",
       "in Egyptian, was made by Joseph Smith, junior, a Vermont farmer, who\n",
       "revealed himself as a mystical prophet in 1825; and how, in short, the\n",

       "Several of the audience, not being much interested in the missionary's\n",

       "related how Smith, junior, with his father, two brothers, and a few\n",
       "disciples, founded the church of the \"Latter Day Saints,\" which,\n",
       "adopted not only in America, but in England, Norway and Sweden, and\n",
       "Germany, counts many artisans, as well as men engaged in the liberal\n",
       "professions, among its members; how a colony was established in Ohio, a\n",
       "temple erected there at a cost of two hundred thousand dollars, and a\n",
       "town built at Kirkland; how Smith became an enterprising banker, and\n",
       "received from a simple mummy showman a papyrus scroll written by\n",
       "Abraham and several famous Egyptians.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Elder's story became somewhat wearisome, and his audience grew\n",
       "gradually less, until it was reduced to twenty passengers.  But this\n",

       "Joseph Smith's bankruptcy in 1837, and how his ruined creditors gave\n",
       "him a coat of tar and feathers; his reappearance some years afterwards,\n",
       "more honourable and honoured than ever, at Independence, Missouri, the\n",
       "chief of a flourishing colony of three thousand disciples, and his\n",
       "pursuit thence by outraged Gentiles, and retirement into the Far West.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ten hearers only were now left, among them honest Passepartout, who was\n",
       "listening with all his ears.  Thus he learned that, after long\n",
       "persecutions, Smith reappeared in Illinois, and in 1839 founded a\n",
       "community at Nauvoo, on the Mississippi, numbering twenty-five thousand\n",
       "souls, of which he became mayor, chief justice, and general-in-chief;\n",
       "that he announced himself, in 1843, as a candidate for the Presidency\n",
       "of the United States; and that finally, being drawn into ambuscade at\n",
       "Carthage, he was thrown into prison, and assassinated by a band of men\n",
       "disguised in masks.\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout was now the only person left in the car, and the Elder,\n",
       "looking him full in the face, reminded him that, two years after the\n",
       "assassination of Joseph Smith, the inspired prophet, Brigham Young, his\n",
       "successor, left Nauvoo for the banks of the Great Salt Lake, where, in\n",
       "the midst of that fertile region, directly on the route of the\n",
       "emigrants who crossed Utah on their way to California, the new colony,\n",
       "thanks to the polygamy practised by the Mormons, had flourished beyond\n",
       "expectations.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And this,\" added Elder William Hitch, \"this is why the jealousy of\n",

       "Lake.  Thence the passengers could observe the vast extent of this\n",
       "interior sea, which is also called the Dead Sea, and into which flows\n",
       "an American Jordan.  It is a picturesque expanse, framed in lofty crags\n",
       "in large strata, encrusted with white salt--a superb sheet of water,\n",
       "which was formerly of larger extent than now, its shores having\n",
       "encroached with the lapse of time, and thus at once reduced its breadth\n",
       "and increased its depth.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Salt Lake, seventy miles long and thirty-five wide, is situated\n",
       "three miles eight hundred feet above the sea.  Quite different from\n",
       "Lake Asphaltite, whose depression is twelve hundred feet below the sea,\n",
       "it contains considerable salt, and one quarter of the weight of its\n",
       "water is solid matter, its specific weight being 1,170, and, after\n",
       "being distilled, 1,000.  Fishes are, of course, unable to live in it,\n",
       "and those which descend through the Jordan, the Weber, and other\n",
       "streams soon perish.\n",
       "\n",

       "verandas and porches, surrounded by gardens bordered with acacias,\n",

       "the town; and in the principal street were the market and several\n",
       "hotels adorned with pavilions.  The place did not seem thickly\n",
       "populated.  The streets were almost deserted, except in the vicinity of\n",
       "the temple, which they only reached after having traversed several\n",
       "quarters surrounded by palisades.  There were many women, which was\n",
       "easily accounted for by the \"peculiar institution\" of the Mormons; but\n",
       "it must not be supposed that all the Mormons are polygamists.  They are\n",
       "free to marry or not, as they please; but it is worth noting that it is\n",
       "mainly the female citizens of Utah who are anxious to marry, as,\n",
       "according to the Mormon religion, maiden ladies are not admitted to the\n",

       "charged, in groups, with conferring happiness on a single Mormon.  His\n",
       "common sense pitied, above all, the husband.  It seemed to him a\n",
       "terrible thing to have to guide so many wives at once across the\n",
       "vicissitudes of life, and to conduct them, as it were, in a body to the\n",
       "Mormon paradise with the prospect of seeing them in the company of the\n",
       "glorious Smith, who doubtless was the chief ornament of that delightful\n",
       "place, to all eternity.  He felt decidedly repelled from such a\n",
       "vocation, and he imagined--perhaps he was mistaken--that the fair ones\n",
       "of Salt Lake City cast rather alarming glances on his person.  Happily,\n",
       "his stay there was but brief.  At four the party found themselves again\n",
       "at the station, took their places in the train, and the whistle sounded\n",
       "for starting.  Just at the moment, however, that the locomotive wheels\n",
       "began to move, cries of \"Stop! stop!\" were heard.\n",
       "\n",
       "Trains, like time and tide, stop for no one.  The gentleman who uttered\n",
       "the cries was evidently a belated Mormon.  He was breathless with\n",
       "running.  Happily for him, the station had neither gates nor barriers.\n",
       "He rushed along the track, jumped on the rear platform of the train,\n",
       "and fell, exhausted, into one of the seats.\n",

       "Passepartout, who had been anxiously watching this amateur gymnast,\n",
       "approached him with lively interest, and learned that he had taken\n",

       "\n",
       "When the Mormon had recovered his breath, Passepartout ventured to ask\n",

       "from San Francisco.  From this point it took an easterly direction\n",
       "towards the jagged Wahsatch Mountains.  It was in the section included\n",
       "between this range and the Rocky Mountains that the American engineers\n",
       "found the most formidable difficulties in laying the road, and that the\n",

       "towards Bitter Creek Valley, to rise again to the dividing ridge of the\n",
       "waters between the Atlantic and the Pacific.  There were many creeks in\n",

       "the most absolute devotion.  She did not comprehend, perhaps, the depth\n",
       "of the sentiment with which her protector inspired her, which she\n",
       "called gratitude, but which, though she was unconscious of it, was\n",
       "really more than that.  Her heart sank within her when she recognised\n",

       "for him?\"\n",

       "Passepartout felt something like a shudder shoot through his frame, but\n",
       "his confidence in his master remained unbroken.\n",
       "\n",
       "Was there any means of detaining Mr. Fogg in the car, to avoid a\n",
       "meeting between him and the colonel?  It ought not to be a difficult\n",
       "task, since that gentleman was naturally sedentary and little curious.\n",
       "The detective, at least, seemed to have found a way; for, after a few\n",
       "moments, he said to Mr. Fogg, \"These are long and slow hours, sir, that\n",
       "we are passing on the railway.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes,\" replied Mr. Fogg; \"but they pass.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You were in the habit of playing whist,\" resumed Fix, \"on the\n",
       "steamers.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes; but it would be difficult to do so here.  I have neither cards\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Oh, but we can easily buy some cards, for they are sold on all the\n",
       "American trains.  And as for partners, if madam plays--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Certainly, sir,\" Aouda quickly replied; \"I understand whist.  It is\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I myself have some pretensions to playing a good game.  Well, here are\n",
       "three of us, and a dummy--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"As you please, sir,\" replied Phileas Fogg, heartily glad to resume his\n",
       "favourite pastime even on the railway.\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout was dispatched in search of the steward, and soon returned\n",
       "with two packs of cards, some pins, counters, and a shelf covered with\n",
       "cloth.\n",
       "\n",
       "The game commenced.  Aouda understood whist sufficiently well, and even\n",
       "received some compliments on her playing from Mr. Fogg.  As for the\n",
       "detective, he was simply an adept, and worthy of being matched against\n",
       "his present opponent.\n",

       "At eleven in the morning the train had reached the dividing ridge of\n",
       "the waters at Bridger Pass, seven thousand five hundred and twenty-four\n",
       "feet above the level of the sea, one of the highest points attained by\n",
       "the track in crossing the Rocky Mountains.  After going about two\n",
       "hundred miles, the travellers at last found themselves on one of those\n",
       "vast plains which extend to the Atlantic, and which nature has made so\n",
       "propitious for laying the iron road.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the declivity of the Atlantic basin the first streams, branches of\n",
       "the North Platte River, already appeared.  The whole northern and\n",
       "eastern horizon was bounded by the immense semi-circular curtain which\n",
       "is formed by the southern portion of the Rocky Mountains, the highest\n",
       "being Laramie Peak.  Between this and the railway extended vast plains,\n",
       "plentifully irrigated.  On the right rose the lower spurs of the\n",
       "mountainous mass which extends southward to the sources of the Arkansas\n",
       "River, one of the great tributaries of the Missouri.\n",
       "\n",
       "At half-past twelve the travellers caught sight for an instant of Fort\n",
       "Halleck, which commands that section; and in a few more hours the Rocky\n",
       "Mountains were crossed.  There was reason to hope, then, that no\n",
       "accident would mark the journey through this difficult country.  The\n",
       "snow had ceased falling, and the air became crisp and cold.  Large\n",
       "birds, frightened by the locomotive, rose and flew off in the distance.\n",
       "No wild beast appeared on the plain.  It was a desert in its vast\n",
       "nakedness.\n",
       "\n",
       "After a comfortable breakfast, served in the car, Mr. Fogg and his\n",
       "partners had just resumed whist, when a violent whistling was heard,\n",
       "and the train stopped.  Passepartout put his head out of the door, but\n",
       "saw nothing to cause the delay; no station was in view.\n",
       "\n",
       "Aouda and Fix feared that Mr. Fogg might take it into his head to get\n",
       "out; but that gentleman contented himself with saying to his servant,\n",
       "\"See what is the matter.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout rushed out of the car.  Thirty or forty passengers had\n",
       "already descended, amongst them Colonel Stamp Proctor.\n",
       "\n",
       "The train had stopped before a red signal which blocked the way.  The\n",
       "engineer and conductor were talking excitedly with a signal-man, whom\n",
       "the station-master at Medicine Bow, the next stopping place, had sent\n",
       "on before.  The passengers drew around and took part in the discussion,\n",
       "in which Colonel Proctor, with his insolent manner, was conspicuous.\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout, joining the group, heard the signal-man say, \"No! you\n",
       "can't pass.  The bridge at Medicine Bow is shaky, and would not bear\n",
       "the weight of the train.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This was a suspension-bridge thrown over some rapids, about a mile from\n",
       "the place where they now were.  According to the signal-man, it was in\n",
       "a ruinous condition, several of the iron wires being broken; and it was\n",
       "impossible to risk the passage.  He did not in any way exaggerate the\n",
       "condition of the bridge.  It may be taken for granted that, rash as the\n",
       "Americans usually are, when they are prudent there is good reason for\n",
       "it.\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout, not daring to apprise his master of what he heard,\n",
       "listened with set teeth, immovable as a statue.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Hum!\" cried Colonel Proctor; \"but we are not going to stay here, I\n",
       "imagine, and take root in the snow?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Colonel,\" replied the conductor, \"we have telegraphed to Omaha for a\n",
       "train, but it is not likely that it will reach Medicine Bow in less\n",
       "than six hours.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Six hours!\" cried Passepartout.\n",
       "\n",

       "as that to reach Medicine Bow on foot.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But it is only a mile from here,\" said one of the passengers.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, but it's on the other side of the river.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And can't we cross that in a boat?\" asked the colonel.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That's impossible.  The creek is swelled by the rains.  It is a rapid,\n",
       "and we shall have to make a circuit of ten miles to the north to find a\n",
       "ford.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The colonel launched a volley of oaths, denouncing the railway company\n",
       "and the conductor; and Passepartout, who was furious, was not\n",
       "disinclined to make common cause with him.  Here was an obstacle,\n",
       "indeed, which all his master's banknotes could not remove.\n",
       "\n",
       "There was a general disappointment among the passengers, who, without\n",
       "reckoning the delay, saw themselves compelled to trudge fifteen miles\n",
       "over a plain covered with snow.  They grumbled and protested, and would\n",
       "certainly have thus attracted Phileas Fogg's attention if he had not\n",
       "been completely absorbed in his game.\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout found that he could not avoid telling his master what had\n",
       "occurred, and, with hanging head, he was turning towards the car, when\n",
       "the engineer, a true Yankee, named Forster called out, \"Gentlemen,\n",
       "perhaps there is a way, after all, to get over.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"On the bridge?\" asked a passenger.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"On the bridge.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"With our train?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"With our train.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout stopped short, and eagerly listened to the engineer.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But the bridge is unsafe,\" urged the conductor.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No matter,\" replied Forster; \"I think that by putting on the very\n",
       "highest speed we might have a chance of getting over.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The devil!\" muttered Passepartout.\n",
       "\n",
       "But a number of the passengers were at once attracted by the engineer's\n",
       "proposal, and Colonel Proctor was especially delighted, and found the\n",
       "plan a very feasible one.  He told stories about engineers leaping\n",
       "their trains over rivers without bridges, by putting on full steam; and\n",
       "many of those present avowed themselves of the engineer's mind.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We have fifty chances out of a hundred of getting over,\" said one.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Eighty! ninety!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout was astounded, and, though ready to attempt anything to\n",
       "get over Medicine Creek, thought the experiment proposed a little too\n",
       "American.  \"Besides,\" thought he, \"there's a still more simple way, and\n",
       "it does not even occur to any of these people!  Sir,\" said he aloud to\n",
       "one of the passengers, \"the engineer's plan seems to me a little\n",
       "dangerous, but--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Eighty chances!\" replied the passenger, turning his back on him.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I know it,\" said Passepartout, turning to another passenger, \"but a\n",
       "simple idea--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ideas are no use,\" returned the American, shrugging his shoulders, \"as\n",
       "the engineer assures us that we can pass.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Doubtless,\" urged Passepartout, \"we can pass, but perhaps it would be\n",
       "more prudent--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What!  Prudent!\" cried Colonel Proctor, whom this word seemed to\n",
       "excite prodigiously.  \"At full speed, don't you see, at full speed!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I know--I see,\" repeated Passepartout; \"but it would be, if not more\n",
       "prudent, since that word displeases you, at least more natural--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Who!  What!  What's the matter with this fellow?\" cried several.\n",
       "\n",
       "The poor fellow did not know to whom to address himself.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Are you afraid?\" asked Colonel Proctor.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I afraid?  Very well; I will show these people that a Frenchman can be\n",
       "as American as they!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"All aboard!\" cried the conductor.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, all aboard!\" repeated Passepartout, and immediately.  \"But they\n",
       "can't prevent me from thinking that it would be more natural for us to\n",
       "cross the bridge on foot, and let the train come after!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "But no one heard this sage reflection, nor would anyone have\n",
       "acknowledged its justice.  The passengers resumed their places in the\n",
       "cars.  Passepartout took his seat without telling what had passed.  The\n",
       "whist-players were quite absorbed in their game.\n",
       "\n",
       "The locomotive whistled vigorously; the engineer, reversing the steam,\n",
       "backed the train for nearly a mile--retiring, like a jumper, in order\n",
       "to take a longer leap.  Then, with another whistle, he began to move\n",
       "forward; the train increased its speed, and soon its rapidity became\n",
       "frightful; a prolonged screech issued from the locomotive; the piston\n",
       "worked up and down twenty strokes to the second.  They perceived that\n",
       "the whole train, rushing on at the rate of a hundred miles an hour,\n",
       "hardly bore upon the rails at all.\n",
       "\n",
       "And they passed over!  It was like a flash.  No one saw the bridge.\n",

       "pair of revolvers.  Aouda remained in the car, as pale as death.\n",
       "\n",
       "The door of the next car opened, and Colonel Proctor appeared on the\n",

       "\n",
       "\"We are twenty minutes late, and we shall not stop.\"\n",

       "\"But I am going to fight a duel with this gentleman.\"\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I'm really very sorry, gentlemen,\" said the conductor.  \"Under any\n",

       "all, as you have not had time to fight here, why not fight as we go\n",
       "along?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That wouldn't be convenient, perhaps, for this gentleman,\" said the\n",
       "colonel, in a jeering tone.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It would be perfectly so,\" replied Phileas Fogg.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, we are really in America,\" thought Passepartout, \"and the\n",
       "conductor is a gentleman of the first order!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "So muttering, he followed his master.\n",
       "\n",
       "The two combatants, their seconds, and the conductor passed through the\n",
       "cars to the rear of the train.  The last car was only occupied by a\n",
       "dozen passengers, whom the conductor politely asked if they would not\n",
       "be so kind as to leave it vacant for a few moments, as two gentlemen\n",
       "had an affair of honour to settle.  The passengers granted the request\n",
       "with alacrity, and straightway disappeared on the platform.\n",
       "\n",
       "The car, which was some fifty feet long, was very convenient for their\n",
       "purpose.  The adversaries might march on each other in the aisle, and\n",
       "fire at their ease.  Never was duel more easily arranged.  Mr. Fogg and\n",
       "Colonel Proctor, each provided with two six-barrelled revolvers,\n",
       "entered the car.  The seconds, remaining outside, shut them in.  They\n",
       "were to begin firing at the first whistle of the locomotive.  After an\n",
       "interval of two minutes, what remained of the two gentlemen would be\n",
       "taken from the car.\n",
       "\n",
       "Nothing could be more simple.  Indeed, it was all so simple that Fix\n",
       "and Passepartout felt their hearts beating as if they would crack.\n",
       "They were listening for the whistle agreed upon, when suddenly savage\n",
       "cries resounded in the air, accompanied by reports which certainly did\n",
       "not issue from the car where the duellists were.  The reports continued\n",
       "in front and the whole length of the train.  Cries of terror proceeded\n",
       "from the interior of the cars.\n",
       "\n",
       "Colonel Proctor and Mr. Fogg, revolvers in hand, hastily quitted their\n",
       "prison, and rushed forward where the noise was most clamorous.  They\n",
       "then perceived that the train was attacked by a band of Sioux.\n",
       "\n",
       "This was not the first attempt of these daring Indians, for more than\n",
       "once they had waylaid trains on the road.  A hundred of them had,\n",
       "according to their habit, jumped upon the steps without stopping the\n",
       "train, with the ease of a clown mounting a horse at full gallop.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Sioux were armed with guns, from which came the reports, to which\n",
       "the passengers, who were almost all armed, responded by revolver-shots.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Indians had first mounted the engine, and half stunned the engineer\n",
       "and stoker with blows from their muskets.  A Sioux chief, wishing to\n",
       "stop the train, but not knowing how to work the regulator, had opened\n",
       "wide instead of closing the steam-valve, and the locomotive was\n",
       "plunging forward with terrific velocity.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Sioux had at the same time invaded the cars, skipping like enraged\n",
       "monkeys over the roofs, thrusting open the doors, and fighting hand to\n",
       "hand with the passengers.  Penetrating the baggage-car, they pillaged\n",
       "it, throwing the trunks out of the train.  The cries and shots were\n",
       "constant.  The travellers defended themselves bravely; some of the cars\n",
       "were barricaded, and sustained a siege, like moving forts, carried\n",
       "along at a speed of a hundred miles an hour.\n",
       "\n",
       "Aouda behaved courageously from the first.  She defended herself like a\n",
       "true heroine with a revolver, which she shot through the broken windows\n",
       "whenever a savage made his appearance.  Twenty Sioux had fallen\n",
       "mortally wounded to the ground, and the wheels crushed those who fell\n",
       "upon the rails as if they had been worms.  Several passengers, shot or\n",
       "stunned, lay on the seats.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was necessary to put an end to the struggle, which had lasted for\n",
       "ten minutes, and which would result in the triumph of the Sioux if the\n",
       "train was not stopped.  Fort Kearney station, where there was a\n",
       "garrison, was only two miles distant; but, that once passed, the Sioux\n",
       "would be masters of the train between Fort Kearney and the station\n",
       "beyond.\n",
       "\n",
       "The conductor was fighting beside Mr. Fogg, when he was shot and fell.\n",
       "At the same moment he cried, \"Unless the train is stopped in five\n",
       "minutes, we are lost!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It shall be stopped,\" said Phileas Fogg, preparing to rush from the\n",
       "car.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Stay, monsieur,\" cried Passepartout; \"I will go.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Fogg had not time to stop the brave fellow, who, opening a door\n",
       "unperceived by the Indians, succeeded in slipping under the car; and\n",
       "while the struggle continued and the balls whizzed across each other\n",
       "over his head, he made use of his old acrobatic experience, and with\n",
       "amazing agility worked his way under the cars, holding on to the\n",
       "chains, aiding himself by the brakes and edges of the sashes, creeping\n",
       "from one car to another with marvellous skill, and thus gaining the\n",
       "forward end of the train.\n",

       "There, suspended by one hand between the baggage-car and the tender,\n",

       "had not a violent concussion jolted this bar out.  The train, now\n",
       "detached from the engine, remained a little behind, whilst the\n",
       "locomotive rushed forward with increased speed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Carried on by the force already acquired, the train still moved for\n",

       "and, despite his suspicions and of the struggle which was going on\n",
       "within him, he lowered his eyes before that calm and frank look.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I will stay,\" said he.\n",
       "\n",
       "A few moments after, Mr. Fogg pressed the young woman's hand, and,\n",
       "having confided to her his precious carpet-bag, went off with the\n",
       "sergeant and his little squad.  But, before going, he had said to the\n",
       "soldiers, \"My friends, I will divide five thousand dollars among you,\n",
       "if we save the prisoners.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "It was then a little past noon.\n",
       "\n",
       "Aouda retired to a waiting-room, and there she waited alone, thinking\n",
       "of the simple and noble generosity, the tranquil courage of Phileas\n",
       "Fogg.  He had sacrificed his fortune, and was now risking his life, all\n",
       "without hesitation, from duty, in silence.\n",
       "\n",
       "Fix did not have the same thoughts, and could scarcely conceal his\n",
       "agitation.  He walked feverishly up and down the platform, but soon\n",
       "resumed his outward composure.  He now saw the folly of which he had\n",
       "been guilty in letting Fogg go alone.  What!  This man, whom he had\n",
       "just followed around the world, was permitted now to separate himself\n",
       "from him!  He began to accuse and abuse himself, and, as if he were\n",
       "director of police, administered to himself a sound lecture for his\n",
       "greenness.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have been an idiot!\" he thought, \"and this man will see it.  He has\n",
       "gone, and won't come back!  But how is it that I, Fix, who have in my\n",
       "pocket a warrant for his arrest, have been so fascinated by him?\n",
       "Decidedly, I am nothing but an ass!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "So reasoned the detective, while the hours crept by all too slowly.  He\n",
       "did not know what to do.  Sometimes he was tempted to tell Aouda all;\n",
       "but he could not doubt how the young woman would receive his\n",
       "confidences.  What course should he take?  He thought of pursuing Fogg\n",
       "across the vast white plains; it did not seem impossible that he might\n",
       "overtake him.  Footsteps were easily printed on the snow!  But soon,\n",
       "under a new sheet, every imprint would be effaced.\n",
       "\n",
       "Fix became discouraged.  He felt a sort of insurmountable longing to\n",
       "abandon the game altogether.  He could now leave Fort Kearney station,\n",
       "and pursue his journey homeward in peace.\n",
       "\n",
       "Towards two o'clock in the afternoon, while it was snowing hard, long\n",
       "whistles were heard approaching from the east.  A great shadow,\n",
       "preceded by a wild light, slowly advanced, appearing still larger\n",
       "through the mist, which gave it a fantastic aspect.  No train was\n",
       "expected from the east, neither had there been time for the succour\n",
       "asked for by telegraph to arrive; the train from Omaha to San Francisco\n",
       "was not due till the next day.  The mystery was soon explained.\n",
       "\n",
       "The locomotive, which was slowly approaching with deafening whistles,\n",
       "was that which, having been detached from the train, had continued its\n",
       "route with such terrific rapidity, carrying off the unconscious\n",
       "engineer and stoker.  It had run several miles, when, the fire becoming\n",
       "low for want of fuel, the steam had slackened; and it had finally\n",
       "stopped an hour after, some twenty miles beyond Fort Kearney.  Neither\n",
       "the engineer nor the stoker was dead, and, after remaining for some\n",
       "time in their swoon, had come to themselves.  The train had then\n",
       "stopped.  The engineer, when he found himself in the desert, and the\n",
       "locomotive without cars, understood what had happened.  He could not\n",
       "imagine how the locomotive had become separated from the train; but he\n",
       "did not doubt that the train left behind was in distress.\n",
       "\n",
       "He did not hesitate what to do.  It would be prudent to continue on to\n",
       "Omaha, for it would be dangerous to return to the train, which the\n",
       "Indians might still be engaged in pillaging.  Nevertheless, he began to\n",
       "rebuild the fire in the furnace; the pressure again mounted, and the\n",
       "locomotive returned, running backwards to Fort Kearney.  This it was\n",
       "which was whistling in the mist.\n",
       "\n",
       "The travellers were glad to see the locomotive resume its place at the\n",
       "head of the train.  They could now continue the journey so terribly\n",
       "interrupted.\n",
       "\n",
       "Aouda, on seeing the locomotive come up, hurried out of the station,\n",
       "and asked the conductor, \"Are you going to start?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"At once, madam.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But the prisoners, our unfortunate fellow-travellers--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I cannot interrupt the trip,\" replied the conductor.  \"We are already\n",
       "three hours behind time.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And when will another train pass here from San Francisco?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"To-morrow evening, madam.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"To-morrow evening!  But then it will be too late!  We must wait--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is impossible,\" responded the conductor.  \"If you wish to go,\n",
       "please get in.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I will not go,\" said Aouda.\n",
       "\n",
       "Fix had heard this conversation.  A little while before, when there was\n",
       "no prospect of proceeding on the journey, he had made up his mind to\n",
       "leave Fort Kearney; but now that the train was there, ready to start,\n",
       "and he had only to take his seat in the car, an irresistible influence\n",
       "held him back.  The station platform burned his feet, and he could not\n",
       "stir.  The conflict in his mind again began; anger and failure stifled\n",
       "him.  He wished to struggle on to the end.\n",
       "\n",
       "Meanwhile the passengers and some of the wounded, among them Colonel\n",
       "Proctor, whose injuries were serious, had taken their places in the\n",
       "train.  The buzzing of the over-heated boiler was heard, and the steam\n",
       "was escaping from the valves.  The engineer whistled, the train\n",
       "started, and soon disappeared, mingling its white smoke with the eddies\n",
       "of the densely falling snow.\n",
       "\n",
       "The detective had remained behind.\n",
       "\n",
       "Several hours passed.  The weather was dismal, and it was very cold.\n",
       "Fix sat motionless on a bench in the station; he might have been\n",
       "thought asleep.  Aouda, despite the storm, kept coming out of the\n",
       "waiting-room, going to the end of the platform, and peering through the\n",
       "tempest of snow, as if to pierce the mist which narrowed the horizon\n",
       "around her, and to hear, if possible, some welcome sound.  She heard\n",
       "and saw nothing.  Then she would return, chilled through, to issue out\n",
       "again after the lapse of a few moments, but always in vain.\n",
       "\n",
       "Evening came, and the little band had not returned.  Where could they\n",
       "be?  Had they found the Indians, and were they having a conflict with\n",
       "them, or were they still wandering amid the mist?  The commander of the\n",
       "fort was anxious, though he tried to conceal his apprehensions.  As\n",
       "night approached, the snow fell less plentifully, but it became\n",
       "intensely cold.  Absolute silence rested on the plains.  Neither flight\n",
       "of bird nor passing of beast troubled the perfect calm.\n",
       "\n",
       "Throughout the night Aouda, full of sad forebodings, her heart stifled\n",
       "with anguish, wandered about on the verge of the plains.  Her\n",
       "imagination carried her far off, and showed her innumerable dangers.\n",
       "What she suffered through the long hours it would be impossible to\n",
       "describe.\n",
       "\n",
       "Fix remained stationary in the same place, but did not sleep.  Once a\n",
       "man approached and spoke to him, and the detective merely replied by\n",
       "shaking his head.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thus the night passed.  At dawn, the half-extinguished disc of the sun\n",
       "rose above a misty horizon; but it was now possible to recognise\n",
       "objects two miles off.  Phileas Fogg and the squad had gone southward;\n",
       "in the south all was still vacancy.  It was then seven o'clock.\n",
       "\n",
       "The captain, who was really alarmed, did not know what course to take.\n",
       "\n",
       "Should he send another detachment to the rescue of the first?  Should\n",
       "he sacrifice more men, with so few chances of saving those already\n",
       "sacrificed?  His hesitation did not last long, however.  Calling one of\n",
       "his lieutenants, he was on the point of ordering a reconnaissance, when\n",
       "gunshots were heard.  Was it a signal?  The soldiers rushed out of the\n",
       "fort, and half a mile off they perceived a little band returning in\n",
       "good order.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Fogg was marching at their head, and just behind him were\n",
       "Passepartout and the other two travellers, rescued from the Sioux.\n",
       "\n",
       "They had met and fought the Indians ten miles south of Fort Kearney.\n",
       "Shortly before the detachment arrived, Passepartout and his companions\n",
       "had begun to struggle with their captors, three of whom the Frenchman\n",
       "had felled with his fists, when his master and the soldiers hastened up\n",
       "to their relief.\n",
       "\n",
       "All were welcomed with joyful cries.  Phileas Fogg distributed the\n",
       "reward he had promised to the soldiers, while Passepartout, not without\n",
       "reason, muttered to himself, \"It must certainly be confessed that I\n",
       "cost my master dear!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Fix, without saying a word, looked at Mr. Fogg, and it would have been\n",
       "difficult to analyse the thoughts which struggled within him.  As for\n",
       "Aouda, she took her protector's hand and pressed it in her own, too\n",
       "much moved to speak.\n",
       "\n",
       "Meanwhile, Passepartout was looking about for the train; he thought he\n",
       "should find it there, ready to start for Omaha, and he hoped that the\n",
       "time lost might be regained.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The train! the train!\" cried he.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Gone,\" replied Fix.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And when does the next train pass here?\" said Phileas Fogg.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not till this evening.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah!\" returned the impassible gentleman quietly.\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Phileas Fogg found himself twenty hours behind time.  Passepartout, the\n",
       "involuntary cause of this delay, was desperate.  He had ruined his\n",
       "master!\n",
       "\n",
       "At this moment the detective approached Mr. Fogg, and, looking him\n",
       "intently in the face, said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Seriously, sir, are you in great haste?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Quite seriously.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have a purpose in asking,\" resumed Fix.  \"Is it absolutely necessary\n",
       "that you should be in New York on the 11th, before nine o'clock in the\n",
       "evening, the time that the steamer leaves for Liverpool?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is absolutely necessary.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And, if your journey had not been interrupted by these Indians, you\n",
       "would have reached New York on the morning of the 11th?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes; with eleven hours to spare before the steamer left.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Good! you are therefore twenty hours behind.  Twelve from twenty\n",
       "leaves eight.  You must regain eight hours.  Do you wish to try to do\n",
       "so?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"On foot?\" asked Mr. Fogg.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No; on a sledge,\" replied Fix.  \"On a sledge with sails.  A man has\n",
       "proposed such a method to me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "It was the man who had spoken to Fix during the night, and whose offer\n",
       "he had refused.\n",
       "\n",
       "Phileas Fogg did not reply at once; but Fix, having pointed out the\n",
       "man, who was walking up and down in front of the station, Mr. Fogg went\n",
       "up to him.  An instant after, Mr. Fogg and the American, whose name was\n",
       "Mudge, entered a hut built just below the fort.\n",
       "\n",
       "There Mr. Fogg examined a curious vehicle, a kind of frame on two long\n",
       "beams, a little raised in front like the runners of a sledge, and upon\n",
       "which there was room for five or six persons.  A high mast was fixed on\n",
       "the frame, held firmly by metallic lashings, to which was attached a\n",
       "large brigantine sail.  This mast held an iron stay upon which to hoist\n",
       "a jib-sail.  Behind, a sort of rudder served to guide the vehicle.  It\n",
       "was, in short, a sledge rigged like a sloop.  During the winter, when\n",
       "the trains are blocked up by the snow, these sledges make extremely\n",
       "rapid journeys across the frozen plains from one station to another.\n",
       "Provided with more sails than a cutter, and with the wind behind them,\n",
       "they slip over the surface of the prairies with a speed equal if not\n",
       "superior to that of the express trains.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Fogg readily made a bargain with the owner of this land-craft.  The\n",
       "wind was favourable, being fresh, and blowing from the west.  The snow\n",
       "had hardened, and Mudge was very confident of being able to transport\n",
       "Mr. Fogg in a few hours to Omaha.  Thence the trains eastward run\n",
       "frequently to Chicago and New York.  It was not impossible that the\n",
       "lost time might yet be recovered; and such an opportunity was not to be\n",
       "rejected.\n",
       "\n",
       "Not wishing to expose Aouda to the discomforts of travelling in the\n",
       "open air, Mr. Fogg proposed to leave her with Passepartout at Fort\n",
       "Kearney, the servant taking upon himself to escort her to Europe by a\n",
       "better route and under more favourable conditions.  But Aouda refused\n",
       "to separate from Mr. Fogg, and Passepartout was delighted with her\n",
       "decision; for nothing could induce him to leave his master while Fix\n",
       "was with him.\n",
       "\n",
       "It would be difficult to guess the detective's thoughts.  Was this\n",
       "conviction shaken by Phileas Fogg's return, or did he still regard him\n",
       "as an exceedingly shrewd rascal, who, his journey round the world\n",
       "completed, would think himself absolutely safe in England?  Perhaps\n",
       "Fix's opinion of Phileas Fogg was somewhat modified; but he was\n",
       "nevertheless resolved to do his duty, and to hasten the return of the\n",
       "whole party to England as much as possible.\n",
       "\n",
       "At eight o'clock the sledge was ready to start.  The passengers took\n",
       "their places on it, and wrapped themselves up closely in their\n",
       "travelling-cloaks.  The two great sails were hoisted, and under the\n",
       "pressure of the wind the sledge slid over the hardened snow with a\n",
       "velocity of forty miles an hour.\n",
       "\n",
       "The distance between Fort Kearney and Omaha, as the birds fly, is at\n",
       "most two hundred miles.  If the wind held good, the distance might be\n",
       "traversed in five hours; if no accident happened the sledge might reach\n",
       "Omaha by one o'clock.\n",
       "\n",
       "What a journey!  The travellers, huddled close together, could not\n",
       "speak for the cold, intensified by the rapidity at which they were\n",
       "going.  The sledge sped on as lightly as a boat over the waves.  When\n",
       "the breeze came skimming the earth the sledge seemed to be lifted off\n",
       "the ground by its sails.  Mudge, who was at the rudder, kept in a\n",
       "straight line, and by a turn of his hand checked the lurches which the\n",
       "vehicle had a tendency to make.  All the sails were up, and the jib was\n",
       "so arranged as not to screen the brigantine.  A top-mast was hoisted,\n",
       "and another jib, held out to the wind, added its force to the other\n",
       "sails.  Although the speed could not be exactly estimated, the sledge\n",
       "could not be going at less than forty miles an hour.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If nothing breaks,\" said Mudge, \"we shall get there!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Fogg had made it for Mudge's interest to reach Omaha within the\n",
       "time agreed on, by the offer of a handsome reward.\n",
       "\n",
       "The prairie, across which the sledge was moving in a straight line, was\n",
       "as flat as a sea.  It seemed like a vast frozen lake.  The railroad\n",
       "which ran through this section ascended from the south-west to the\n",
       "north-west by Great Island, Columbus, an important Nebraska town,\n",
       "Schuyler, and Fremont, to Omaha.  It followed throughout the right bank\n",
       "of the Platte River.  The sledge, shortening this route, took a chord\n",
       "of the arc described by the railway.  Mudge was not afraid of being\n",
       "stopped by the Platte River, because it was frozen.  The road, then,\n",
       "was quite clear of obstacles, and Phileas Fogg had but two things to\n",
       "fear--an accident to the sledge, and a change or calm in the wind.\n",
       "\n",
       "But the breeze, far from lessening its force, blew as if to bend the\n",
       "mast, which, however, the metallic lashings held firmly.  These\n",
       "lashings, like the chords of a stringed instrument, resounded as if\n",
       "vibrated by a violin bow.  The sledge slid along in the midst of a\n",
       "plaintively intense melody.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Those chords give the fifth and the octave,\" said Mr. Fogg.\n",
       "\n",
       "These were the only words he uttered during the journey.  Aouda, cosily\n",
       "packed in furs and cloaks, was sheltered as much as possible from the\n",
       "attacks of the freezing wind.  As for Passepartout, his face was as red\n",
       "as the sun's disc when it sets in the mist, and he laboriously inhaled\n",
       "the biting air.  With his natural buoyancy of spirits, he began to hope\n",
       "again.  They would reach New York on the evening, if not on the\n",
       "morning, of the 11th, and there was still some chances that it would be\n",
       "before the steamer sailed for Liverpool.\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout even felt a strong desire to grasp his ally, Fix, by the\n",
       "hand.  He remembered that it was the detective who procured the sledge,\n",
       "the only means of reaching Omaha in time; but, checked by some\n",
       "presentiment, he kept his usual reserve.  One thing, however,\n",
       "Passepartout would never forget, and that was the sacrifice which Mr.\n",
       "Fogg had made, without hesitation, to rescue him from the Sioux.  Mr.\n",
       "Fogg had risked his fortune and his life. No!  His servant would never\n",
       "forget that!\n",
       "\n",
       "While each of the party was absorbed in reflections so different, the\n",
       "sledge flew past over the vast carpet of snow.  The creeks it passed\n",
       "over were not perceived.  Fields and streams disappeared under the\n",
       "uniform whiteness.  The plain was absolutely deserted.  Between the\n",
       "Union Pacific road and the branch which unites Kearney with Saint\n",
       "Joseph it formed a great uninhabited island.  Neither village, station,\n",
       "nor fort appeared.  From time to time they sped by some phantom-like\n",
       "tree, whose white skeleton twisted and rattled in the wind.  Sometimes\n",
       "flocks of wild birds rose, or bands of gaunt, famished, ferocious\n",
       "prairie-wolves ran howling after the sledge.  Passepartout, revolver in\n",
       "hand, held himself ready to fire on those which came too near.  Had an\n",
       "accident then happened to the sledge, the travellers, attacked by these\n",
       "beasts, would have been in the most terrible danger; but it held on its\n",
       "even course, soon gained on the wolves, and ere long left the howling\n",
       "band at a safe distance behind.\n",
       "\n",
       "About noon Mudge perceived by certain landmarks that he was crossing\n",
       "the Platte River.  He said nothing, but he felt certain that he was now\n",
       "within twenty miles of Omaha.  In less than an hour he left the rudder\n",
       "and furled his sails, whilst the sledge, carried forward by the great\n",
       "impetus the wind had given it, went on half a mile further with its\n",
       "sails unspread.\n",

       "During the day she skirted Long Island, passed Fire Island, and\n",

       "Not the least in the world.  It was Phileas Fogg, Esquire.  As for\n",
       "Captain Speedy, he was shut up in his cabin under lock and key, and was\n",
       "uttering loud cries, which signified an anger at once pardonable and\n",
       "excessive.\n",
       "\n",
       "What had happened was very simple.  Phileas Fogg wished to go to\n",

       "Fogg had taken passage for Bordeaux, and, during the thirty hours he\n",
       "had been on board, had so shrewdly managed with his banknotes that the\n",
       "sailors and stokers, who were only an occasional crew, and were not on\n",
       "the best terms with the captain, went over to him in a body.  This was\n",
       "why Phileas Fogg was in command instead of Captain Speedy; why the\n",
       "captain was a prisoner in his cabin; and why, in short, the Henrietta\n",
       "was directing her course towards Liverpool.  It was very clear, to see\n",
       "Mr. Fogg manage the craft, that he had been a sailor.\n",
       "\n",
       "How the adventure ended will be seen anon.  Aouda was anxious, though\n",

       "\n",
       "If, then--for there were \"ifs\" still--the sea did not become too\n",
       "boisterous, if the wind did not veer round to the east, if no accident\n",
       "happened to the boat or its machinery, the Henrietta might cross the\n",
       "three thousand miles from New York to Liverpool in the nine days,\n",
       "between the 12th and the 21st of December.  It is true that, once\n",
       "arrived, the affair on board the Henrietta, added to that of the Bank\n",
       "of England, might create more difficulties for Mr. Fogg than he\n",
       "imagined or could desire.\n",
       "\n",
       "During the first days, they went along smoothly enough.  The sea was\n",
       "not very unpropitious, the wind seemed stationary in the north-east,\n",
       "the sails were hoisted, and the Henrietta ploughed across the waves\n",
       "like a real trans-Atlantic steamer.\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout was delighted.  His master's last exploit, the\n",
       "consequences of which he ignored, enchanted him.  Never had the crew\n",
       "seen so jolly and dexterous a fellow.  He formed warm friendships with\n",
       "the sailors, and amazed them with his acrobatic feats.  He thought they\n",
       "managed the vessel like gentlemen, and that the stokers fired up like\n",
       "heroes.  His loquacious good-humour infected everyone.  He had\n",
       "forgotten the past, its vexations and delays.  He only thought of the\n",
       "end, so nearly accomplished; and sometimes he boiled over with\n",
       "impatience, as if heated by the furnaces of the Henrietta.  Often,\n",
       "also, the worthy fellow revolved around Fix, looking at him with a\n",
       "keen, distrustful eye; but he did not speak to him, for their old\n",
       "intimacy no longer existed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Fix, it must be confessed, understood nothing of what was going on.\n",
       "The conquest of the Henrietta, the bribery of the crew, Fogg managing\n",
       "the boat like a skilled seaman, amazed and confused him.  He did not\n",
       "know what to think.  For, after all, a man who began by stealing\n",
       "fifty-five thousand pounds might end by stealing a vessel; and Fix was\n",
       "not unnaturally inclined to conclude that the Henrietta under Fogg's\n",
       "command, was not going to Liverpool at all, but to some part of the\n",
       "world where the robber, turned into a pirate, would quietly put himself\n",
       "in safety.  The conjecture was at least a plausible one, and the\n",
       "detective began to seriously regret that he had embarked on the affair.\n",
       "\n",
       "As for Captain Speedy, he continued to howl and growl in his cabin; and\n",
       "Passepartout, whose duty it was to carry him his meals, courageous as\n",
       "he was, took the greatest precautions.  Mr. Fogg did not seem even to\n",
       "know that there was a captain on board.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the 13th they passed the edge of the Banks of Newfoundland, a\n",
       "dangerous locality; during the winter, especially, there are frequent\n",
       "fogs and heavy gales of wind.  Ever since the evening before the\n",
       "barometer, suddenly falling, had indicated an approaching change in the\n",
       "atmosphere; and during the night the temperature varied, the cold\n",
       "became sharper, and the wind veered to the south-east.\n",
       "\n",
       "This was a misfortune.  Mr. Fogg, in order not to deviate from his\n",
       "course, furled his sails and increased the force of the steam; but the\n",
       "vessel's speed slackened, owing to the state of the sea, the long waves\n",
       "of which broke against the stern.  She pitched violently, and this\n",
       "retarded her progress.  The breeze little by little swelled into a\n",
       "tempest, and it was to be feared that the Henrietta might not be able\n",
       "to maintain herself upright on the waves.\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout's visage darkened with the skies, and for two days the\n",
       "poor fellow experienced constant fright.  But Phileas Fogg was a bold\n",
       "mariner, and knew how to maintain headway against the sea; and he kept\n",
       "on his course, without even decreasing his steam.  The Henrietta, when\n",
       "she could not rise upon the waves, crossed them, swamping her deck, but\n",
       "passing safely.  Sometimes the screw rose out of the water, beating its\n",
       "protruding end, when a mountain of water raised the stern above the\n",
       "waves; but the craft always kept straight ahead.\n",
       "\n",
       "The wind, however, did not grow as boisterous as might have been\n",
       "feared; it was not one of those tempests which burst, and rush on with\n",
       "a speed of ninety miles an hour.  It continued fresh, but, unhappily,\n",
       "it remained obstinately in the south-east, rendering the sails useless.\n",
       "\n",
       "The 16th of December was the seventy-fifth day since Phileas Fogg's\n",
       "departure from London, and the Henrietta had not yet been seriously\n",
       "delayed.  Half of the voyage was almost accomplished, and the worst\n",
       "localities had been passed.  In summer, success would have been\n",
       "well-nigh certain.  In winter, they were at the mercy of the bad\n",
       "season.  Passepartout said nothing; but he cherished hope in secret,\n",
       "and comforted himself with the reflection that, if the wind failed\n",
       "them, they might still count on the steam.\n",
       "\n",
       "On this day the engineer came on deck, went up to Mr. Fogg, and began\n",
       "to speak earnestly with him.  Without knowing why it was a\n",
       "presentiment, perhaps Passepartout became vaguely uneasy.  He would\n",
       "have given one of his ears to hear with the other what the engineer was\n",
       "saying.  He finally managed to catch a few words, and was sure he heard\n",
       "his master say, \"You are certain of what you tell me?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Certain, sir,\" replied the engineer.  \"You must remember that, since\n",
       "we started, we have kept up hot fires in all our furnaces, and, though\n",
       "we had coal enough to go on short steam from New York to Bordeaux, we\n",
       "haven't enough to go with all steam from New York to Liverpool.\" \"I\n",
       "will consider,\" replied Mr. Fogg.\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout understood it all; he was seized with mortal anxiety.  The\n",
       "coal was giving out!  \"Ah, if my master can get over that,\" muttered\n",
       "he, \"he'll be a famous man!\"  He could not help imparting to Fix what\n",
       "he had overheard.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Then you believe that we really are going to Liverpool?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Of course.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ass!\" replied the detective, shrugging his shoulders and turning on\n",
       "his heel.\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout was on the point of vigorously resenting the epithet, the\n",
       "reason of which he could not for the life of him comprehend; but he\n",
       "reflected that the unfortunate Fix was probably very much disappointed\n",
       "and humiliated in his self-esteem, after having so awkwardly followed a\n",
       "false scent around the world, and refrained.\n",
       "\n",
       "And now what course would Phileas Fogg adopt?  It was difficult to\n",
       "imagine.  Nevertheless he seemed to have decided upon one, for that\n",
       "evening he sent for the engineer, and said to him, \"Feed all the fires\n",
       "until the coal is exhausted.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "A few moments after, the funnel of the Henrietta vomited forth torrents\n",
       "of smoke.  The vessel continued to proceed with all steam on; but on\n",
       "the 18th, the engineer, as he had predicted, announced that the coal\n",
       "would give out in the course of the day.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do not let the fires go down,\" replied Mr. Fogg.  \"Keep them up to the\n",
       "last.  Let the valves be filled.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Towards noon Phileas Fogg, having ascertained their position, called\n",
       "Passepartout, and ordered him to go for Captain Speedy.  It was as if\n",
       "the honest fellow had been commanded to unchain a tiger.  He went to\n",
       "the poop, saying to himself, \"He will be like a madman!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "In a few moments, with cries and oaths, a bomb appeared on the\n",
       "poop-deck.  The bomb was Captain Speedy.  It was clear that he was on\n",
       "the point of bursting.  \"Where are we?\"  were the first words his anger\n",
       "permitted him to utter.  Had the poor man been an apoplectic, he could\n",
       "never have recovered from his paroxysm of wrath.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Where are we?\" he repeated, with purple face.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Seven hundred and seven miles from Liverpool,\" replied Mr. Fogg, with\n",
       "imperturbable calmness.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Pirate!\" cried Captain Speedy.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have sent for you, sir--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Pickaroon!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"--sir,\" continued Mr. Fogg, \"to ask you to sell me your vessel.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No!  By all the devils, no!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But I shall be obliged to burn her.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Burn the Henrietta!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes; at least the upper part of her.  The coal has given out.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Burn my vessel!\" cried Captain Speedy, who could scarcely pronounce\n",
       "the words.  \"A vessel worth fifty thousand dollars!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Here are sixty thousand,\" replied Phileas Fogg, handing the captain a\n",
       "roll of bank-bills.  This had a prodigious effect on Andrew Speedy.  An\n",
       "American can scarcely remain unmoved at the sight of sixty thousand\n",
       "dollars.  The captain forgot in an instant his anger, his imprisonment,\n",
       "and all his grudges against his passenger.  The Henrietta was twenty\n",
       "years old; it was a great bargain.  The bomb would not go off after\n",
       "all.  Mr. Fogg had taken away the match.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And I shall still have the iron hull,\" said the captain in a softer\n",
       "tone.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The iron hull and the engine.  Is it agreed?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Agreed.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "And Andrew Speedy, seizing the banknotes, counted them and consigned\n",
       "them to his pocket.\n",
       "\n",
       "During this colloquy, Passepartout was as white as a sheet, and Fix\n",
       "seemed on the point of having an apoplectic fit.  Nearly twenty\n",
       "thousand pounds had been expended, and Fogg left the hull and engine to\n",
       "the captain, that is, near the whole value of the craft!  It was true,\n",
       "however, that fifty-five thousand pounds had been stolen from the Bank.\n",
       "\n",
       "When Andrew Speedy had pocketed the money, Mr. Fogg said to him, \"Don't\n",
       "let this astonish you, sir.  You must know that I shall lose twenty\n",
       "thousand pounds, unless I arrive in London by a quarter before nine on\n",
       "the evening of the 21st of December.  I missed the steamer at New York,\n",
       "and as you refused to take me to Liverpool--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And I did well!\" cried Andrew Speedy; \"for I have gained at least\n",
       "forty thousand dollars by it!\"  He added, more sedately, \"Do you know\n",
       "one thing, Captain--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Fogg.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Captain Fogg, you've got something of the Yankee about you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "And, having paid his passenger what he considered a high compliment, he\n",
       "was going away, when Mr. Fogg said, \"The vessel now belongs to me?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Certainly, from the keel to the truck of the masts--all the wood, that\n",
       "is.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Very well.  Have the interior seats, bunks, and frames pulled down,\n",
       "and burn them.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "It was necessary to have dry wood to keep the steam up to the adequate\n",
       "pressure, and on that day the poop, cabins, bunks, and the spare deck\n",
       "were sacrificed.  On the next day, the 19th of December, the masts,\n",
       "rafts, and spars were burned; the crew worked lustily, keeping up the\n",
       "fires.  Passepartout hewed, cut, and sawed away with all his might.\n",
       "There was a perfect rage for demolition.\n",
       "\n",
       "The railings, fittings, the greater part of the deck, and top sides\n",
       "disappeared on the 20th, and the Henrietta was now only a flat hulk.\n",
       "But on this day they sighted the Irish coast and Fastnet Light.  By ten\n",
       "in the evening they were passing Queenstown.  Phileas Fogg had only\n",
       "twenty-four hours more in which to get to London; that length of time\n",
       "was necessary to reach Liverpool, with all steam on.  And the steam was\n",
       "about to give out altogether!\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Sir,\" said Captain Speedy, who was now deeply interested in Mr. Fogg's\n",

       "only opposite Queenstown.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\"Yes.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Can we enter the harbour?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not under three hours.  Only at high tide.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Stay,\" replied Mr. Fogg calmly, without betraying in his features that\n",
       "by a supreme inspiration he was about to attempt once more to conquer\n",
       "ill-fortune.\n",
       "\n",

       "to put off the mails.  These mails are carried to Dublin by express\n",
       "trains always held in readiness to start; from Dublin they are sent on\n",
       "to Liverpool by the most rapid boats, and thus gain twelve hours on the\n",
       "Atlantic steamers.\n",
       "\n",
       "Phileas Fogg counted on gaining twelve hours in the same way.  Instead\n",
       "of arriving at Liverpool the next evening by the Henrietta, he would be\n",
       "there by noon, and would therefore have time to reach London before a\n",
       "quarter before nine in the evening.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Henrietta entered Queenstown Harbour at one o'clock in the morning,\n",
       "it then being high tide; and Phileas Fogg, after being grasped heartily\n",
       "by the hand by Captain Speedy, left that gentleman on the levelled hulk\n",
       "of his craft, which was still worth half what he had sold it for.\n",
       "\n",
       "The party went on shore at once.  Fix was greatly tempted to arrest Mr.\n",
       "Fogg on the spot; but he did not.  Why?  What struggle was going on\n",

       "understand that he had made a grave mistake?  He did not, however,\n",
       "abandon Mr. Fogg.  They all got upon the train, which was just ready to\n",
       "start, at half-past one; at dawn of day they were in Dublin; and they\n",

       "Passepartout, when he saw his master arrested, would have fallen upon\n",

       "and courageous Fogg was arrested as a robber.  The young woman's heart\n",
       "revolted against so heinous a charge, and when she saw that she could\n",
       "attempt to do nothing to save her protector, she wept bitterly.\n",

       "\n",
       "The thought then struck Passepartout, that he was the cause of this new\n",

       "Fix revealed his true character and purpose, why had he not told Mr.\n",
       "Fogg?  If the latter had been warned, he would no doubt have given Fix\n",
       "proof of his innocence, and satisfied him of his mistake; at least, Fix\n",
       "would not have continued his journey at the expense and on the heels of\n",
       "his master, only to arrest him the moment he set foot on English soil.\n",
       "Passepartout wept till he was blind, and felt like blowing his brains\n",
       "out.\n",
       "\n",
       "Aouda and he had remained, despite the cold, under the portico of the\n",

       "\n",
       "That gentleman was really ruined, and that at the moment when he was\n",
       "about to attain his end.  This arrest was fatal.  Having arrived at\n",
       "Liverpool at twenty minutes before twelve on the 21st of December, he\n",
       "had till a quarter before nine that evening to reach the Reform Club,\n",
       "that is, nine hours and a quarter; the journey from Liverpool to London\n",
       "was six hours.\n",
       "\n",
       "If anyone, at this moment, had entered the Custom House, he would have\n",

       "upon a wooden bench.  He was not, it is true, resigned; but this last\n",
       "blow failed to force him into an outward betrayal of any emotion.  Was\n",
       "he being devoured by one of those secret rages, all the more terrible\n",
       "because contained, and which only burst forth, with an irresistible\n",
       "force, at the last moment?  No one could tell.  There he sat, calmly\n",
       "waiting--for what?  Did he still cherish hope?  Did he still believe,\n",
       "now that the door of this prison was closed upon him, that he would\n",
       "succeed?\n",
       "\n",
       "However that may have been, Mr. Fogg carefully put his watch upon the\n",
       "table, and observed its advancing hands.  Not a word escaped his lips,\n",
       "but his look was singularly set and stern.  The situation, in any\n",
       "event, was a terrible one, and might be thus stated: if Phileas Fogg\n",
       "was honest he was ruined; if he was a knave, he was caught.\n",

       "Possibly; for once he walked slowly around the room.  But the door was\n",
       "locked, and the window heavily barred with iron rods.  He sat down\n",
       "again, and drew his journal from his pocket.  On the line where these\n",

       "\n",
       "At thirty-three minutes past two he heard a singular noise outside,\n",

       "affairs in order.  Passepartout continually ascended and descended the\n",
       "stairs.  The hours were long for him. He listened at his master's door,\n",
       "and looked through the keyhole, as if he had a perfect right so to do,\n",
       "and as if he feared that something terrible might happen at any moment.\n",
       "Sometimes he thought of Fix, but no longer in anger.  Fix, like all the\n",
       "world, had been mistaken in Phileas Fogg, and had only done his duty in\n",
       "tracking and arresting him; while he, Passepartout. . . .  This thought\n",
       "haunted him, and he never ceased cursing his miserable folly.\n",
       "\n",
       "Finding himself too wretched to remain alone, he knocked at Aouda's\n",
       "door, went into her room, seated himself, without speaking, in a\n",
       "corner, and looked ruefully at the young woman. Aouda was still pensive.\n",
       "\n",
       "About half-past seven in the evening Mr. Fogg sent to know if Aouda\n",
       "would receive him, and in a few moments he found himself alone with her.\n",
       "\n",
       "Phileas Fogg took a chair, and sat down near the fireplace, opposite\n",
       "Aouda.  No emotion was visible on his face.  Fogg returned was exactly\n",
       "the Fogg who had gone away; there was the same calm, the same\n",
       "impassibility.\n",
       "\n",
       "He sat several minutes without speaking; then, bending his eyes on\n",
       "Aouda, \"Madam,\" said he, \"will you pardon me for bringing you to\n",
       "England?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I, Mr. Fogg!\" replied Aouda, checking the pulsations of her heart.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Please let me finish,\" returned Mr. Fogg.  \"When I decided to bring\n",
       "you far away from the country which was so unsafe for you, I was rich,\n",
       "and counted on putting a portion of my fortune at your disposal; then\n",
       "your existence would have been free and happy.  But now I am ruined.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I know it, Mr. Fogg,\" replied Aouda; \"and I ask you in my turn, will\n",
       "you forgive me for having followed you, and--who knows?--for having,\n",
       "perhaps, delayed you, and thus contributed to your ruin?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Madam, you could not remain in India, and your safety could only be\n",
       "assured by bringing you to such a distance that your persecutors could\n",
       "not take you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"So, Mr. Fogg,\" resumed Aouda, \"not content with rescuing me from a\n",
       "terrible death, you thought yourself bound to secure my comfort in a\n",
       "foreign land?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, madam; but circumstances have been against me.  Still, I beg to\n",
       "place the little I have left at your service.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But what will become of you, Mr. Fogg?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"As for me, madam,\" replied the gentleman, coldly, \"I have need of\n",
       "nothing.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But how do you look upon the fate, sir, which awaits you?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"As I am in the habit of doing.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"At least,\" said Aouda, \"want should not overtake a man like you.  Your\n",
       "friends--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have no friends, madam.\"\n",

       "\"Your relatives--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have no longer any relatives.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I pity you, then, Mr. Fogg, for solitude is a sad thing, with no heart\n",

       "shared by two sympathetic souls, may be borne with patience.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"They say so, madam.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mr. Fogg,\" said Aouda, rising and seizing his hand, \"do you wish at\n",
       "once a kinswoman and friend?  Will you have me for your wife?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Fogg, at this, rose in his turn.  There was an unwonted light in\n",
       "his eyes, and a slight trembling of his lips.  Aouda looked into his\n",
       "face.  The sincerity, rectitude, firmness, and sweetness of this soft\n",
       "glance of a noble woman, who could dare all to save him to whom she\n",
       "owed all, at first astonished, then penetrated him.  He shut his eyes\n",
       "for an instant, as if to avoid her look.  When he opened them again, \"I\n",
       "love you!\" he said, simply.  \"Yes, by all that is holiest, I love you,\n",
       "and I am entirely yours!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah!\" cried Aouda, pressing his hand to her heart.\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout was summoned and appeared immediately.  Mr. Fogg still\n",
       "held Aouda's hand in his own; Passepartout understood, and his big,\n",
       "round face became as radiant as the tropical sun at its zenith.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Fogg asked him if it was not too late to notify the Reverend Samuel\n",
       "Wilson, of Marylebone parish, that evening.\n",
       "\n",
       "Passepartout smiled his most genial smile, and said, \"Never too late.\"\n",

       "\n",
       "It is time to relate what a change took place in English public opinion\n",
       "when it transpired that the real bankrobber, a certain James Strand,\n",
       "had been arrested, on the 17th day of December, at Edinburgh.  Three\n",
       "days before, Phileas Fogg had been a criminal, who was being\n",
       "desperately followed up by the police; now he was an honourable\n",
       "gentleman, mathematically pursuing his eccentric journey round the\n",
       "world.\n",
       "\n",
       "The papers resumed their discussion about the wager; all those who had\n",
       "laid bets, for or against him, revived their interest, as if by magic;\n",
       "the \"Phileas Fogg bonds\" again became negotiable, and many new wagers\n",
       "were made.  Phileas Fogg's name was once more at a premium on 'Change.\n",
       "\n",
       "His five friends of the Reform Club passed these three days in a state\n",
       "of feverish suspense.  Would Phileas Fogg, whom they had forgotten,\n",
       "reappear before their eyes!  Where was he at this moment?  The 17th of\n",
       "December, the day of James Strand's arrest, was the seventy-sixth since\n",
       "Phileas Fogg's departure, and no news of him had been received.  Was he\n",
       "dead?  Had he abandoned the effort, or was he continuing his journey\n",
       "along the route agreed upon?  And would he appear on Saturday, the 21st\n",
       "of December, at a quarter before nine in the evening, on the threshold\n",

       "\n",
       "The anxiety in which, for three days, London society existed, cannot be\n",
       "described.  Telegrams were sent to America and Asia for news of Phileas\n",
       "Fogg.  Messengers were dispatched to the house in Saville Row morning\n",
       "and evening.  No news.  The police were ignorant what had become of the\n",
       "detective, Fix, who had so unfortunately followed up a false scent.\n",
       "Bets increased, nevertheless, in number and value.  Phileas Fogg, like\n",
       "a racehorse, was drawing near his last turning-point.  The bonds were\n",
       "quoted, no longer at a hundred below par, but at twenty, at ten, and at\n",
       "five; and paralytic old Lord Albemarle bet even in his favour.\n",
       "\n",
       "A great crowd was collected in Pall Mall and the neighbouring streets\n",
       "on Saturday evening; it seemed like a multitude of brokers permanently\n",
       "established around the Reform Club.  Circulation was impeded, and\n",
       "everywhere disputes, discussions, and financial transactions were going\n",
       "on.  The police had great difficulty in keeping back the crowd, and as\n",
       "the hour when Phileas Fogg was due approached, the excitement rose to\n",
       "its highest pitch.\n",
       "\n",
       "The five antagonists of Phileas Fogg had met in the great saloon of the\n",

       "the engineer, Gauthier Ralph, the director of the Bank of England, and\n",
       "Thomas Flanagan, the brewer, one and all waited anxiously.\n",
       "\n",
       "When the clock indicated twenty minutes past eight, Andrew Stuart got\n",
       "up, saying, \"Gentlemen, in twenty minutes the time agreed upon between\n",
       "Mr. Fogg and ourselves will have expired.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What time did the last train arrive from Liverpool?\"  asked Thomas\n",

       "therefore, regard the bet as won.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Wait; don't let us be too hasty,\" replied Samuel Fallentin.  \"You know\n",
       "that Mr. Fogg is very eccentric.  His punctuality is well known; he\n",
       "never arrives too soon, or too late; and I should not be surprised if\n",
       "he appeared before us at the last minute.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why,\" said Andrew Stuart nervously, \"if I should see him, I should not\n",

       "\n",
       "\"The fact is,\" resumed Thomas Flanagan, \"Mr. Fogg's project was\n",
       "absurdly foolish.  Whatever his punctuality, he could not prevent the\n",
       "delays which were certain to occur; and a delay of only two or three\n",
       "days would be fatal to his tour.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Observe, too,\" added John Sullivan, \"that we have received no\n",

       "route.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He has lost, gentleman,\" said Andrew Stuart, \"he has a hundred times\n",
       "lost!  You know, besides, that the China the only steamer he could have\n",
       "taken from New York to get here in time arrived yesterday.  I have seen\n",
       "a list of the passengers, and the name of Phileas Fogg is not among\n",
       "them.  Even if we admit that fortune has favoured him, he can scarcely\n",
       "have reached America.  I think he will be at least twenty days\n",
       "behind-hand, and that Lord Albemarle will lose a cool five thousand.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is clear,\" replied Gauthier Ralph; \"and we have nothing to do but\n",
       "to present Mr. Fogg's cheque at Barings to-morrow.\"\n",

       "At this moment, the hands of the club clock pointed to twenty minutes\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I wouldn't give up my four thousand of the bet,\" said Andrew Stuart,\n",

       "The players took up their cards, but could not keep their eyes off the\n",

       "\"Seventeen minutes to nine,\" said Thomas Flanagan, as he cut the cards\n",
       "which Ralph handed to him.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then there was a moment of silence.  The great saloon was perfectly\n",
       "quiet; but the murmurs of the crowd outside were heard, with now and\n",

       "One minute more, and the wager would be won.  Andrew Stuart and his\n",

       "At the fortieth second, nothing.  At the fiftieth, still nothing.\n",

       "The players rose from their seats.\n",

       "Phileas Fogg, going eastward, saw the sun pass the meridian eighty\n",
       "times, his friends in London only saw it pass the meridian seventy-nine\n",

       "\n",
       "And Passepartout's famous family watch, which had always kept London\n",

      "IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG AND PASSEPARTOUT ACCEPT EACH OTHER,\r\n",
      "THE ONE AS MASTER, THE OTHER AS MAN\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Phileas Fogg lived, in 1872, at No. 7, Saville Row, Burlington\r\n",
      "Gardens, the house in which Sheridan died in 1814.  He was one of the\r\n",
      "most noticeable members of the Reform Club, though he seemed always to\r\n",
      "avoid attracting attention; an enigmatical personage, about whom little\r\n",
      "was known, except that he was a polished man of the world.  People said\r\n",
      "that he resembled Byron--at least that his head was Byronic; but he was\r\n",
      "a bearded, tranquil Byron, who might live on a thousand years without\r\n",
      "growing old.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Certainly an Englishman, it was more doubtful whether Phileas Fogg was\r\n",
      "a Londoner.  He was never seen on 'Change, nor at the Bank, nor in the\r\n",
      "counting-rooms of the \"City\"; no ships ever came into London docks of\r\n",
      "which he was the owner; he had no public employment; he had never been\r\n",
      "entered at any of the Inns of Court, either at the Temple, or Lincoln's\r\n",
      "Inn, or Gray's Inn; nor had his voice ever resounded in the Court of\r\n",
      "Chancery, or in the Exchequer, or the Queen's Bench, or the\r\n",
      "Ecclesiastical Courts.  He certainly was not a manufacturer; nor was he\r\n",
      "a merchant or a gentleman farmer.  His name was strange to the\r\n",
      "scientific and learned societies, and he never was known to take part\r\n",
      "in the sage deliberations of the Royal Institution or the London\r\n",
      "Institution, the Artisan's Association, or the Institution of Arts and\r\n",
      "Sciences.  He belonged, in fact, to none of the numerous societies\r\n",
      "which swarm in the English capital, from the Harmonic to that of the\r\n",
      "Entomologists, founded mainly for the purpose of abolishing pernicious\r\n",
      "insects.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Phileas Fogg was a member of the Reform, and that was all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The way in which he got admission to this exclusive club was simple\r\n",
      "enough.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was recommended by the Barings, with whom he had an open credit.\r\n",
      "His cheques were regularly paid at sight from his account current,\r\n",
      "which was always flush.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Was Phileas Fogg rich?  Undoubtedly.  But those who knew him best could\r\n",
      "not imagine how he had made his fortune, and Mr. Fogg was the last\r\n",
      "person to whom to apply for the information.  He was not lavish, nor,\r\n",
      "on the contrary, avaricious; for, whenever he knew that money was\r\n",
      "needed for a noble, useful, or benevolent purpose, he supplied it\r\n",
      "quietly and sometimes anonymously.  He was, in short, the least\r\n",
      "communicative of men.  He talked very little, and seemed all the more\r\n",
      "mysterious for his taciturn manner.  His daily habits were quite open\r\n",
      "to observation; but whatever he did was so exactly the same thing that\r\n",
      "he had always done before, that the wits of the curious were fairly\r\n",
      "puzzled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Had he travelled?  It was likely, for no one seemed to know the world\r\n",
      "more familiarly; there was no spot so secluded that he did not appear\r\n",
      "to have an intimate acquaintance with it.  He often corrected, with a\r\n",
      "few clear words, the thousand conjectures advanced by members of the\r\n",
      "club as to lost and unheard-of travellers, pointing out the true\r\n",
      "probabilities, and seeming as if gifted with a sort of second sight, so\r\n",
      "often did events justify his predictions.  He must have travelled\r\n",
      "everywhere, at least in the spirit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was at least certain that Phileas Fogg had not absented himself from\r\n",
      "London for many years.  Those who were honoured by a better\r\n",
      "acquaintance with him than the rest, declared that nobody could pretend\r\n",
      "to have ever seen him anywhere else.  His sole pastimes were reading\r\n",
      "the papers and playing whist.  He often won at this game, which, as a\r\n",
      "silent one, harmonised with his nature; but his winnings never went\r\n",
      "into his purse, being reserved as a fund for his charities.  Mr. Fogg\r\n",
      "played, not to win, but for the sake of playing.  The game was in his\r\n",
      "eyes a contest, a struggle with a difficulty, yet a motionless,\r\n",
      "unwearying struggle, congenial to his tastes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Phileas Fogg was not known to have either wife or children, which may\r\n",
      "happen to the most honest people; either relatives or near friends,\r\n",
      "which is certainly more unusual.  He lived alone in his house in\r\n",
      "Saville Row, whither none penetrated.  A single domestic sufficed to\r\n",
      "serve him.  He breakfasted and dined at the club, at hours\r\n",
      "mathematically fixed, in the same room, at the same table, never taking\r\n",
      "his meals with other members, much less bringing a guest with him; and\r\n",
      "went home at exactly midnight, only to retire at once to bed.  He never\r\n",
      "used the cosy chambers which the Reform provides for its favoured\r\n",
      "members.  He passed ten hours out of the twenty-four in Saville Row,\r\n",
      "either in sleeping or making his toilet.  When he chose to take a walk\r\n",
      "it was with a regular step in the entrance hall with its mosaic\r\n",
      "flooring, or in the circular gallery with its dome supported by twenty\r\n",
      "red porphyry Ionic columns, and illumined by blue painted windows.\r\n",
      "When he breakfasted or dined all the resources of the club--its\r\n",
      "kitchens and pantries, its buttery and dairy--aided to crowd his table\r\n",
      "with their most succulent stores; he was served by the gravest waiters,\r\n",
      "in dress coats, and shoes with swan-skin soles, who proffered the\r\n",
      "viands in special porcelain, and on the finest linen; club decanters,\r\n",
      "of a lost mould, contained his sherry, his port, and his\r\n",
      "cinnamon-spiced claret; while his beverages were refreshingly cooled\r\n",
      "with ice, brought at great cost from the American lakes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If to live in this style is to be eccentric, it must be confessed that\r\n",
      "there is something good in eccentricity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The mansion in Saville Row, though not sumptuous, was exceedingly\r\n",
      "comfortable.  The habits of its occupant were such as to demand but\r\n",
      "little from the sole domestic, but Phileas Fogg required him to be\r\n",
      "almost superhumanly prompt and regular.  On this very 2nd of October he\r\n",
      "had dismissed James Forster, because that luckless youth had brought\r\n",
      "him shaving-water at eighty-four degrees Fahrenheit instead of\r\n",
      "eighty-six; and he was awaiting his successor, who was due at the house\r\n",
      "between eleven and half-past.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Phileas Fogg was seated squarely in his armchair, his feet close\r\n",
      "together like those of a grenadier on parade, his hands resting on his\r\n",
      "knees, his body straight, his head erect; he was steadily watching a\r\n",
      "complicated clock which indicated the hours, the minutes, the seconds,\r\n",
      "the days, the months, and the years.  At exactly half-past eleven Mr.\r\n",
      "Fogg would, according to his daily habit, quit Saville Row, and repair\r\n",
      "to the Reform.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A rap at this moment sounded on the door of the cosy apartment where\r\n",
      "Phileas Fogg was seated, and James Forster, the dismissed servant,\r\n",
      "appeared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The new servant,\" said he.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A young man of thirty advanced and bowed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You are a Frenchman, I believe,\" asked Phileas Fogg, \"and your name is\r\n",
      "John?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Jean, if monsieur pleases,\" replied the newcomer, \"Jean Passepartout,\r\n",
      "a surname which has clung to me because I have a natural aptness for\r\n",
      "going out of one business into another.  I believe I'm honest,\r\n",
      "monsieur, but, to be outspoken, I've had several trades.  I've been an\r\n",
      "itinerant singer, a circus-rider, when I used to vault like Leotard,\r\n",
      "and dance on a rope like Blondin.  Then I got to be a professor of\r\n",
      "gymnastics, so as to make better use of my talents; and then I was a\r\n",
      "sergeant fireman at Paris, and assisted at many a big fire.  But I\r\n",
      "quitted France five years ago, and, wishing to taste the sweets of\r\n",
      "domestic life, took service as a valet here in England.  Finding myself\r\n",
      "out of place, and hearing that Monsieur Phileas Fogg was the most exact\r\n",
      "and settled gentleman in the United Kingdom, I have come to monsieur in\r\n",
      "the hope of living with him a tranquil life, and forgetting even the\r\n",
      "name of Passepartout.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Passepartout suits me,\" responded Mr. Fogg.  \"You are well recommended\r\n",
      "to me; I hear a good report of you.  You know my conditions?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, monsieur.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good!  What time is it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Twenty-two minutes after eleven,\" returned Passepartout, drawing an\r\n",
      "enormous silver watch from the depths of his pocket.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You are too slow,\" said Mr. Fogg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Pardon me, monsieur, it is impossible--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You are four minutes too slow.  No matter; it's enough to mention the\r\n",
      "error.  Now from this moment, twenty-nine minutes after eleven, a.m.,\r\n",
      "this Wednesday, 2nd October, you are in my service.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Phileas Fogg got up, took his hat in his left hand, put it on his head\r\n",

      "Madame Tussaud's as lively as my new master!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Madame Tussaud's \"people,\" let it be said, are of wax, and are much\r\n",
      "visited in London; speech is all that is wanting to make them human.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "During his brief interview with Mr. Fogg, Passepartout had been\r\n",
      "carefully observing him.  He appeared to be a man about forty years of\r\n",
      "age, with fine, handsome features, and a tall, well-shaped figure; his\r\n",
      "hair and whiskers were light, his forehead compact and unwrinkled, his\r\n",
      "face rather pale, his teeth magnificent.  His countenance possessed in\r\n",
      "the highest degree what physiognomists call \"repose in action,\" a\r\n",
      "quality of those who act rather than talk.  Calm and phlegmatic, with a\r\n",
      "clear eye, Mr. Fogg seemed a perfect type of that English composure\r\n",
      "which Angelica Kauffmann has so skilfully represented on canvas.  Seen\r\n",
      "in the various phases of his daily life, he gave the idea of being\r\n",
      "perfectly well-balanced, as exactly regulated as a Leroy chronometer.\r\n",
      "Phileas Fogg was, indeed, exactitude personified, and this was betrayed\r\n",
      "even in the expression of his very hands and feet; for in men, as well\r\n",
      "as in animals, the limbs themselves are expressive of the passions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was so exact that he was never in a hurry, was always ready, and was\r\n",
      "economical alike of his steps and his motions.  He never took one step\r\n",
      "too many, and always went to his destination by the shortest cut; he\r\n",
      "made no superfluous gestures, and was never seen to be moved or\r\n",
      "agitated.  He was the most deliberate person in the world, yet always\r\n",
      "reached his destination at the exact moment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He lived alone, and, so to speak, outside of every social relation; and\r\n",
      "as he knew that in this world account must be taken of friction, and\r\n",
      "that friction retards, he never rubbed against anybody.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for Passepartout, he was a true Parisian of Paris.  Since he had\r\n",
      "abandoned his own country for England, taking service as a valet, he\r\n",
      "had in vain searched for a master after his own heart.  Passepartout\r\n",
      "was by no means one of those pert dunces depicted by Moliere with a\r\n",
      "bold gaze and a nose held high in the air; he was an honest fellow,\r\n",
      "with a pleasant face, lips a trifle protruding, soft-mannered and\r\n",
      "serviceable, with a good round head, such as one likes to see on the\r\n",
      "shoulders of a friend.  His eyes were blue, his complexion rubicund,\r\n",
      "his figure almost portly and well-built, his body muscular, and his\r\n",
      "physical powers fully developed by the exercises of his younger days.\r\n",
      "His brown hair was somewhat tumbled; for, while the ancient sculptors\r\n",
      "are said to have known eighteen methods of arranging Minerva's tresses,\r\n",
      "Passepartout was familiar with but one of dressing his own: three\r\n",
      "strokes of a large-tooth comb completed his toilet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It would be rash to predict how Passepartout's lively nature would\r\n",
      "agree with Mr. Fogg.  It was impossible to tell whether the new servant\r\n",
      "would turn out as absolutely methodical as his master required;\r\n",
      "experience alone could solve the question.  Passepartout had been a\r\n",
      "sort of vagrant in his early years, and now yearned for repose; but so\r\n",
      "far he had failed to find it, though he had already served in ten\r\n",
      "English houses.  But he could not take root in any of these; with\r\n",
      "chagrin, he found his masters invariably whimsical and irregular,\r\n",
      "constantly running about the country, or on the look-out for adventure.\r\n",
      "His last master, young Lord Longferry, Member of Parliament, after\r\n",
      "passing his nights in the Haymarket taverns, was too often brought home\r\n",
      "in the morning on policemen's shoulders.  Passepartout, desirous of\r\n",
      "respecting the gentleman whom he served, ventured a mild remonstrance\r\n",
      "on such conduct; which, being ill-received, he took his leave.  Hearing\r\n",
      "that Mr. Phileas Fogg was looking for a servant, and that his life was\r\n",
      "one of unbroken regularity, that he neither travelled nor stayed from\r\n",
      "home overnight, he felt sure that this would be the place he was after.\r\n",
      "He presented himself, and was accepted, as has been seen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At half-past eleven, then, Passepartout found himself alone in the\r\n",
      "house in Saville Row.  He began its inspection without delay, scouring\r\n",
      "it from cellar to garret.  So clean, well-arranged, solemn a mansion\r\n",
      "pleased him; it seemed to him like a snail's shell, lighted and warmed\r\n",
      "by gas, which sufficed for both these purposes.  When Passepartout\r\n",
      "reached the second story he recognised at once the room which he was to\r\n",
      "inhabit, and he was well satisfied with it.  Electric bells and\r\n",
      "speaking-tubes afforded communication with the lower stories; while on\r\n",
      "the mantel stood an electric clock, precisely like that in Mr. Fogg's\r\n",
      "bedchamber, both beating the same second at the same instant.  \"That's\r\n",
      "good, that'll do,\" said Passepartout to himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He suddenly observed, hung over the clock, a card which, upon\r\n",
      "inspection, proved to be a programme of the daily routine of the house.\r\n",
      "It comprised all that was required of the servant, from eight in the\r\n",
      "morning, exactly at which hour Phileas Fogg rose, till half-past\r\n",
      "eleven, when he left the house for the Reform Club--all the details of\r\n",
      "service, the tea and toast at twenty-three minutes past eight, the\r\n",
      "shaving-water at thirty-seven minutes past nine, and the toilet at\r\n",
      "twenty minutes before ten.  Everything was regulated and foreseen that\r\n",
      "was to be done from half-past eleven a.m. till midnight, the hour at\r\n",
      "which the methodical gentleman retired.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Fogg's wardrobe was amply supplied and in the best taste.  Each\r\n",
      "pair of trousers, coat, and vest bore a number, indicating the time of\r\n",
      "year and season at which they were in turn to be laid out for wearing;\r\n",
      "and the same system was applied to the master's shoes.  In short, the\r\n",
      "house in Saville Row, which must have been a very temple of disorder\r\n",
      "and unrest under the illustrious but dissipated Sheridan, was cosiness,\r\n",
      "comfort, and method idealised.  There was no study, nor were there\r\n",
      "books, which would have been quite useless to Mr. Fogg; for at the\r\n",
      "Reform two libraries, one of general literature and the other of law\r\n",
      "and politics, were at his service.  A moderate-sized safe stood in his\r\n",
      "bedroom, constructed so as to defy fire as well as burglars; but\r\n",
      "Passepartout found neither arms nor hunting weapons anywhere;\r\n",
      "everything betrayed the most tranquil and peaceable habits.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Having scrutinised the house from top to bottom, he rubbed his hands, a\r\n",
      "broad smile overspread his features, and he said joyfully, \"This is\r\n",
      "just what I wanted!  Ah, we shall get on together, Mr. Fogg and I!\r\n",
      "What a domestic and regular gentleman!  A real machine; well, I don't\r\n",

      "seventy-five times, and his left foot before his right five hundred and\r\n",
      "seventy-six times, reached the Reform Club, an imposing edifice in Pall\r\n",
      "Mall, which could not have cost less than three millions.  He repaired\r\n",
      "at once to the dining-room, the nine windows of which open upon a\r\n",
      "tasteful garden, where the trees were already gilded with an autumn\r\n",
      "colouring; and took his place at the habitual table, the cover of which\r\n",
      "had already been laid for him.  His breakfast consisted of a side-dish,\r\n",
      "a broiled fish with Reading sauce, a scarlet slice of roast beef\r\n",
      "garnished with mushrooms, a rhubarb and gooseberry tart, and a morsel\r\n",
      "of Cheshire cheese, the whole being washed down with several cups of\r\n",
      "tea, for which the Reform is famous.  He rose at thirteen minutes to\r\n",
      "one, and directed his steps towards the large hall, a sumptuous\r\n",
      "apartment adorned with lavishly-framed paintings.  A flunkey handed him\r\n",
      "an uncut Times, which he proceeded to cut with a skill which betrayed\r\n",
      "familiarity with this delicate operation.  The perusal of this paper\r\n",
      "absorbed Phileas Fogg until a quarter before four, whilst the Standard,\r\n",
      "his next task, occupied him till the dinner hour.  Dinner passed as\r\n",
      "breakfast had done, and Mr. Fogg re-appeared in the reading-room and\r\n",
      "sat down to the Pall Mall at twenty minutes before six.  Half an hour\r\n",
      "later several members of the Reform came in and drew up to the\r\n",
      "fireplace, where a coal fire was steadily burning.  They were Mr.\r\n",
      "Fogg's usual partners at whist: Andrew Stuart, an engineer; John\r\n",
      "Sullivan and Samuel Fallentin, bankers; Thomas Flanagan, a brewer; and\r\n",
      "Gauthier Ralph, one of the Directors of the Bank of England--all rich\r\n",
      "and highly respectable personages, even in a club which comprises the\r\n",
      "princes of English trade and finance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, Ralph,\" said Thomas Flanagan, \"what about that robbery?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh,\" replied Stuart, \"the Bank will lose the money.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"On the contrary,\" broke in Ralph, \"I hope we may put our hands on the\r\n",
      "robber.  Skilful detectives have been sent to all the principal ports\r\n",
      "of America and the Continent, and he'll be a clever fellow if he slips\r\n",
      "through their fingers.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But have you got the robber's description?\" asked Stuart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In the first place, he is no robber at all,\" returned Ralph,\r\n",
      "positively.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What! a fellow who makes off with fifty-five thousand pounds, no\r\n",
      "robber?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Perhaps he's a manufacturer, then.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The Daily Telegraph says that he is a gentleman.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was Phileas Fogg, whose head now emerged from behind his newspapers,\r\n",
      "who made this remark.  He bowed to his friends, and entered into the\r\n",
      "conversation.  The affair which formed its subject, and which was town\r\n",
      "talk, had occurred three days before at the Bank of England.  A package\r\n",
      "of banknotes, to the value of fifty-five thousand pounds, had been\r\n",
      "taken from the principal cashier's table, that functionary being at the\r\n",
      "moment engaged in registering the receipt of three shillings and\r\n",
      "sixpence.  Of course, he could not have his eyes everywhere.  Let it be\r\n",
      "observed that the Bank of England reposes a touching confidence in the\r\n",
      "honesty of the public.  There are neither guards nor gratings to\r\n",
      "protect its treasures; gold, silver, banknotes are freely exposed, at\r\n",
      "the mercy of the first comer.  A keen observer of English customs\r\n",
      "relates that, being in one of the rooms of the Bank one day, he had the\r\n",
      "curiosity to examine a gold ingot weighing some seven or eight pounds.\r\n",
      "He took it up, scrutinised it, passed it to his neighbour, he to the\r\n",
      "next man, and so on until the ingot, going from hand to hand, was\r\n",
      "transferred to the end of a dark entry; nor did it return to its place\r\n",
      "for half an hour.  Meanwhile, the cashier had not so much as raised his\r\n",
      "head.  But in the present instance things had not gone so smoothly.\r\n",
      "The package of notes not being found when five o'clock sounded from the\r\n",
      "ponderous clock in the \"drawing office,\" the amount was passed to the\r\n",
      "account of profit and loss.  As soon as the robbery was discovered,\r\n",
      "picked detectives hastened off to Liverpool, Glasgow, Havre, Suez,\r\n",
      "Brindisi, New York, and other ports, inspired by the proffered reward\r\n",
      "of two thousand pounds, and five per cent. on the sum that might be\r\n",
      "recovered.  Detectives were also charged with narrowly watching those\r\n",
      "who arrived at or left London by rail, and a judicial examination was\r\n",
      "at once entered upon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were real grounds for supposing, as the Daily Telegraph said,\r\n",
      "that the thief did not belong to a professional band.  On the day of\r\n",
      "the robbery a well-dressed gentleman of polished manners, and with a\r\n",
      "well-to-do air, had been observed going to and fro in the paying room\r\n",
      "where the crime was committed.  A description of him was easily\r\n",
      "procured and sent to the detectives; and some hopeful spirits, of whom\r\n",
      "Ralph was one, did not despair of his apprehension.  The papers and\r\n",
      "clubs were full of the affair, and everywhere people were discussing\r\n",
      "the probabilities of a successful pursuit; and the Reform Club was\r\n",
      "especially agitated, several of its members being Bank officials.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ralph would not concede that the work of the detectives was likely to\r\n",
      "be in vain, for he thought that the prize offered would greatly\r\n",
      "stimulate their zeal and activity.  But Stuart was far from sharing\r\n",
      "this confidence; and, as they placed themselves at the whist-table,\r\n",
      "they continued to argue the matter.  Stuart and Flanagan played\r\n",
      "together, while Phileas Fogg had Fallentin for his partner.  As the\r\n",
      "game proceeded the conversation ceased, excepting between the rubbers,\r\n",
      "when it revived again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I maintain,\" said Stuart, \"that the chances are in favour of the\r\n",
      "thief, who must be a shrewd fellow.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, but where can he fly to?\" asked Ralph.  \"No country is safe for\r\n",
      "him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Pshaw!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where could he go, then?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, I don't know that.  The world is big enough.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It was once,\" said Phileas Fogg, in a low tone.  \"Cut, sir,\" he added,\r\n",
      "handing the cards to Thomas Flanagan.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The discussion fell during the rubber, after which Stuart took up its\r\n",
      "thread.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do you mean by `once'?  Has the world grown smaller?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" returned Ralph.  \"I agree with Mr. Fogg.  The world has\r\n",
      "grown smaller, since a man can now go round it ten times more quickly\r\n",
      "than a hundred years ago.  And that is why the search for this thief\r\n",
      "will be more likely to succeed.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And also why the thief can get away more easily.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Be so good as to play, Mr. Stuart,\" said Phileas Fogg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the incredulous Stuart was not convinced, and when the hand was\r\n",
      "finished, said eagerly: \"You have a strange way, Ralph, of proving that\r\n",
      "the world has grown smaller.  So, because you can go round it in three\r\n",
      "months--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In eighty days,\" interrupted Phileas Fogg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That is true, gentlemen,\" added John Sullivan.  \"Only eighty days, now\r\n",
      "that the section between Rothal and Allahabad, on the Great Indian\r\n",
      "Peninsula Railway, has been opened.  Here is the estimate made by the\r\n",

      "a pocket almanac, and added,  \"As today is Wednesday, the 2nd of\r\n",

      "certainly did not bet to win, and had only staked the twenty thousand\r\n",
      "pounds, half of his fortune, because he foresaw that he might have to\r\n",
      "expend the other half to carry out this difficult, not to say\r\n",

      "out from under eyebrows which he was incessantly twitching.  He was\r\n",
      "just now manifesting unmistakable signs of impatience, nervously pacing\r\n",
      "up and down, and unable to stand still for a moment.  This was Fix, one\r\n",
      "of the detectives who had been dispatched from England in search of the\r\n",

      "characters, or bore a resemblance to the description of the criminal,\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "nowadays!  A fellow gets hung for a handful of shillings!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mr. Fix,\" said the consul, \"I like your way of talking, and hope\r\n",
      "you'll succeed; but I fear you will find it far from easy.  Don't you\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Consul,\" remarked the detective, dogmatically, \"great robbers always\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Little by little the scene on the quay became more animated; sailors of\r\n",
      "various nations, merchants, ship-brokers, porters, fellahs, bustled to\r\n",
      "and fro as if the steamer were immediately expected.  The weather was\r\n",
      "clear, and slightly chilly.  The minarets of the town loomed above the\r\n",
      "houses in the pale rays of the sun.  A jetty pier, some two thousand\r\n",
      "yards along, extended into the roadstead.  A number of fishing-smacks\r\n",
      "and coasting boats, some retaining the fantastic fashion of ancient\r\n",
      "galleys, were discernible on the Red Sea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he passed among the busy crowd, Fix, according to habit, scrutinised\r\n",
      "the passers-by with a keen, rapid glance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was now half-past ten.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"How long will she stop at Suez?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Four hours; long enough to get in her coal.  It is thirteen hundred\r\n",
      "and ten miles from Suez to Aden, at the other end of the Red Sea, and\r\n",
      "she has to take in a fresh coal supply.\"\r\n",

      "at Suez, so as to reach the Dutch or French colonies in Asia by some\r\n",
      "other route.  He ought to know that he would not be safe an hour in\r\n",
      "India, which is English soil.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Unless,\" objected the consul, \"he is exceptionally shrewd.  An English\r\n",

      "else.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This observation furnished the detective food for thought, and\r\n",
      "meanwhile the consul went away to his office.  Fix, left alone, was\r\n",
      "more impatient than ever, having a presentiment that the robber was on\r\n",
      "board the Mongolia.  If he had indeed left London intending to reach\r\n",
      "the New World, he would naturally take the route via India, which was\r\n",
      "less watched and more difficult to watch than that of the Atlantic.\r\n",
      "But Fix's reflections were soon interrupted by a succession of sharp\r\n",
      "whistles, which announced the arrival of the Mongolia.  The porters and\r\n",
      "fellahs rushed down the quay, and a dozen boats pushed off from the\r\n",
      "shore to go and meet the steamer.  Soon her gigantic hull appeared\r\n",
      "passing along between the banks, and eleven o'clock struck as she\r\n",
      "anchored in the road.  She brought an unusual number of passengers,\r\n",
      "some of whom remained on deck to scan the picturesque panorama of the\r\n",
      "town, while the greater part disembarked in the boats, and landed on\r\n",
      "the quay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fix took up a position, and carefully examined each face and figure\r\n",
      "which made its appearance.  Presently one of the passengers, after\r\n",
      "vigorously pushing his way through the importunate crowd of porters,\r\n",
      "came up to him and politely asked if he could point out the English\r\n",
      "consulate, at the same time showing a passport which he wished to have\r\n",
      "visaed.  Fix instinctively took the passport, and with a rapid glance\r\n",
      "read the description of its bearer.  An involuntary motion of surprise\r\n",
      "nearly escaped him, for the description in the passport was identical\r\n",
      "with that of the bank robber which he had received from Scotland Yard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is this your passport?\" asked he.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, it's my master's.\"\r\n",

      "on arrival at each locality.  This methodical record thus contained an\r\n",
      "account of everything needed, and Mr. Fogg always knew whether he was\r\n",

      "sights.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I hope so, Monsieur Fix.  You see, a man of sound sense ought not to\r\n",

      "railway train upon a steamer again, pretending to make the tour of the\r\n",

      "cease at Bombay.\"\r\n",

      "give half a crown to find out.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After this meeting, Passepartout and Fix got into the habit of chatting\r\n",
      "together, the latter making it a point to gain the worthy man's\r\n",
      "confidence.  He frequently offered him a glass of whiskey or pale ale\r\n",
      "in the steamer bar-room, which Passepartout never failed to accept with\r\n",
      "graceful alacrity, mentally pronouncing Fix the best of good fellows.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile the Mongolia was pushing forward rapidly; on the 13th, Mocha,\r\n",
      "surrounded by its ruined walls whereon date-trees were growing, was\r\n",
      "sighted, and on the mountains beyond were espied vast coffee-fields.\r\n",
      "Passepartout was ravished to behold this celebrated place, and thought\r\n",
      "that, with its circular walls and dismantled fort, it looked like an\r\n",
      "immense coffee-cup and saucer. The following night they passed through\r\n",
      "the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, which means in Arabic The Bridge of Tears,\r\n",
      "and the next day they put in at Steamer Point, north-west of Aden\r\n",
      "harbour, to take in coal.  This matter of fuelling steamers is a\r\n",
      "serious one at such distances from the coal-mines; it costs the\r\n",
      "Peninsular Company some eight hundred thousand pounds a year.  In these\r\n",
      "distant seas, coal is worth three or four pounds sterling a ton.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Mongolia had still sixteen hundred and fifty miles to traverse\r\n",
      "before reaching Bombay, and was obliged to remain four hours at Steamer\r\n",
      "Point to coal up.  But this delay, as it was foreseen, did not affect\r\n",
      "Phileas Fogg's programme; besides, the Mongolia, instead of reaching\r\n",
      "Aden on the morning of the 15th, when she was due, arrived there on the\r\n",
      "evening of the 14th, a gain of fifteen hours.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Fogg and his servant went ashore at Aden to have the passport again\r\n",
      "visaed; Fix, unobserved, followed them.  The visa procured, Mr. Fogg\r\n",
      "returned on board to resume his former habits; while Passepartout,\r\n",
      "according to custom, sauntered about among the mixed population of\r\n",
      "Somalis, Banyans, Parsees, Jews, Arabs, and Europeans who comprise the\r\n",
      "twenty-five thousand inhabitants of Aden.  He gazed with wonder upon\r\n",
      "the fortifications which make this place the Gibraltar of the Indian\r\n",
      "Ocean, and the vast cisterns where the English engineers were still at\r\n",
      "work, two thousand years after the engineers of Solomon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very curious, very curious,\" said Passepartout to himself, on\r\n",
      "returning to the steamer.  \"I see that it is by no means useless to\r\n",
      "travel, if a man wants to see something new.\"  At six p.m.  the\r\n",
      "Mongolia slowly moved out of the roadstead, and was soon once more on\r\n",
      "the Indian Ocean.  She had a hundred and sixty-eight hours in which to\r\n",
      "reach Bombay, and the sea was favourable, the wind being in the\r\n",
      "north-west, and all sails aiding the engine.  The steamer rolled but\r\n",
      "little, the ladies, in fresh toilets, reappeared on deck, and the\r\n",
      "singing and dancing were resumed.  The trip was being accomplished most\r\n",
      "successfully, and Passepartout was enchanted with the congenial\r\n",
      "companion which chance had secured him in the person of the delightful\r\n",
      "Fix.  On Sunday, October 20th, towards noon, they came in sight of the\r\n",
      "Indian coast: two hours later the pilot came on board.  A range of\r\n",
      "hills lay against the sky in the horizon, and soon the rows of palms\r\n",
      "which adorn Bombay came distinctly into view.  The steamer entered the\r\n",
      "road formed by the islands in the bay, and at half-past four she hauled\r\n",
      "up at the quays of Bombay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "all thirteen of the tricks, concluded this fine campaign with a\r\n",
      "brilliant victory.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Mongolia was due at Bombay on the 22nd; she arrived on the 20th.\r\n",

      "leaving the Mongolia than he saw at once that they were to leave Bombay\r\n",
      "as they had done Suez and Paris, and that the journey would be extended\r\n",
      "at least as far as Calcutta, and perhaps beyond that place.  He began\r\n",
      "to ask himself if this bet that Mr. Fogg talked about was not really in\r\n",
      "good earnest, and whether his fate was not in truth forcing him,\r\n",
      "despite his love of repose, around the world in eighty days!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Having purchased the usual quota of shirts and shoes, he took a\r\n",
      "leisurely promenade about the streets, where crowds of people of many\r\n",
      "nationalities--Europeans, Persians with pointed caps, Banyas with round\r\n",
      "turbans, Sindes with square bonnets, Parsees with black mitres, and\r\n",

      "thrifty, civilised, intelligent, and austere of the East Indians, among\r\n",
      "whom are counted the richest native merchants of Bombay--were\r\n",
      "celebrating a sort of religious carnival, with processions and shows,\r\n",
      "in the midst of which Indian dancing-girls, clothed in rose-coloured\r\n",
      "gauze, looped up with gold and silver, danced airily, but with perfect\r\n",
      "modesty, to the sound of viols and the clanging of tambourines.  It is\r\n",
      "needless to say that Passepartout watched these curious ceremonies with\r\n",
      "staring eyes and gaping mouth, and that his countenance was that of the\r\n",
      "greenest booby imaginable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Unhappily for his master, as well as himself, his curiosity drew him\r\n",
      "unconsciously farther off than he intended to go.  At last, having seen\r\n",
      "the Parsee carnival wind away in the distance, he was turning his steps\r\n",
      "towards the station, when he happened to espy the splendid pagoda on\r\n",
      "Malabar Hill, and was seized with an irresistible desire to see its\r\n",
      "interior.  He was quite ignorant that it is forbidden to Christians to\r\n",
      "enter certain Indian temples, and that even the faithful must not go in\r\n",
      "without first leaving their shoes outside the door.  It may be said\r\n",
      "here that the wise policy of the British Government severely punishes a\r\n",
      "disregard of the practices of the native religions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout, however, thinking no harm, went in like a simple tourist,\r\n",
      "and was soon lost in admiration of the splendid Brahmin ornamentation\r\n",
      "which everywhere met his eyes, when of a sudden he found himself\r\n",
      "sprawling on the sacred flagging.  He looked up to behold three enraged\r\n",
      "priests, who forthwith fell upon him; tore off his shoes, and began to\r\n",
      "beat him with loud, savage exclamations.  The agile Frenchman was soon\r\n",
      "upon his feet again, and lost no time in knocking down two of his\r\n",
      "long-gowned adversaries with his fists and a vigorous application of\r\n",
      "his toes; then, rushing out of the pagoda as fast as his legs could\r\n",
      "carry him, he soon escaped the third priest by mingling with the crowd\r\n",
      "in the streets.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At five minutes before eight, Passepartout, hatless, shoeless, and\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "necessary.  Passepartout did not observe the detective, who stood in an\r\n",

      "Fogg's whist partners on the Mongolia, now on his way to join his corps\r\n",
      "at Benares.  Sir Francis was a tall, fair man of fifty, who had greatly\r\n",

      "at this moment calculating in his mind the number of hours spent since\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Because the railway stopped at the base of these mountains, which the\r\n",

      "Kandallah, on the other side.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Passepartout, his feet comfortably wrapped in his travelling-blanket,\r\n",
      "was sound asleep and did not dream that anybody was talking about him.\r\n",
      "\"The Government is very severe upon that kind of offence.  It takes\r\n",

      "respected, and if your servant were caught--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "master.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The conversation fell again.  During the night the train left the\r\n",
      "mountains behind, and passed Nassik, and the next day proceeded over\r\n",
      "the flat, well-cultivated country of the Khandeish, with its straggling\r\n",
      "villages, above which rose the minarets of the pagodas.  This fertile\r\n",
      "territory is watered by numerous small rivers and limpid streams,\r\n",
      "mostly tributaries of the Godavery.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout, on waking and looking out, could not realise that he was\r\n",
      "actually crossing India in a railway train.  The locomotive, guided by\r\n",
      "an English engineer and fed with English coal, threw out its smoke upon\r\n",
      "cotton, coffee, nutmeg, clove, and pepper plantations, while the steam\r\n",
      "curled in spirals around groups of palm-trees, in the midst of which\r\n",
      "were seen picturesque bungalows, viharis (sort of abandoned\r\n",
      "monasteries), and marvellous temples enriched by the exhaustless\r\n",
      "ornamentation of Indian architecture.  Then they came upon vast tracts\r\n",
      "extending to the horizon, with jungles inhabited by snakes and tigers,\r\n",
      "which fled at the noise of the train; succeeded by forests penetrated\r\n",
      "by the railway, and still haunted by elephants which, with pensive\r\n",
      "eyes, gazed at the train as it passed.  The travellers crossed, beyond\r\n",
      "Milligaum, the fatal country so often stained with blood by the\r\n",
      "sectaries of the goddess Kali.  Not far off rose Ellora, with its\r\n",
      "graceful pagodas, and the famous Aurungabad, capital of the ferocious\r\n",
      "Aureng-Zeb, now the chief town of one of the detached provinces of the\r\n",
      "kingdom of the Nizam.  It was thereabouts that Feringhea, the Thuggee\r\n",
      "chief, king of the stranglers, held his sway.  These ruffians, united\r\n",
      "by a secret bond, strangled victims of every age in honour of the\r\n",
      "goddess Death, without ever shedding blood; there was a period when\r\n",
      "this part of the country could scarcely be travelled over without\r\n",
      "corpses being found in every direction.  The English Government has\r\n",
      "succeeded in greatly diminishing these murders, though the Thuggees\r\n",
      "still exist, and pursue the exercise of their horrible rites.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At half-past twelve the train stopped at Burhampoor where Passepartout\r\n",
      "was able to purchase some Indian slippers, ornamented with false\r\n",
      "pearls, in which, with evident vanity, he proceeded to encase his feet.\r\n",
      "The travellers made a hasty breakfast and started off for Assurghur,\r\n",
      "after skirting for a little the banks of the small river Tapty, which\r\n",
      "empties into the Gulf of Cambray, near Surat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout was now plunged into absorbing reverie.  Up to his arrival\r\n",
      "at Bombay, he had entertained hopes that their journey would end there;\r\n",
      "but, now that they were plainly whirling across India at full speed, a\r\n",
      "sudden change had come over the spirit of his dreams.  His old vagabond\r\n",
      "nature returned to him; the fantastic ideas of his youth once more took\r\n",
      "possession of him.  He came to regard his master's project as intended\r\n",
      "in good earnest, believed in the reality of the bet, and therefore in\r\n",
      "the tour of the world and the necessity of making it without fail\r\n",
      "within the designated period.  Already he began to worry about possible\r\n",
      "delays, and accidents which might happen on the way.  He recognised\r\n",
      "himself as being personally interested in the wager, and trembled at\r\n",
      "the thought that he might have been the means of losing it by his\r\n",
      "unpardonable folly of the night before.  Being much less cool-headed\r\n",
      "than Mr. Fogg, he was much more restless, counting and recounting the\r\n",
      "days passed over, uttering maledictions when the train stopped, and\r\n",
      "accusing it of sluggishness, and mentally blaming Mr. Fogg for not\r\n",
      "having bribed the engineer.  The worthy fellow was ignorant that, while\r\n",
      "it was possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer, it could\r\n",
      "not be done on the railway.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The train entered the defiles of the Sutpour Mountains, which separate\r\n",
      "the Khandeish from Bundelcund, towards evening.  The next day Sir\r\n",
      "Francis Cromarty asked Passepartout what time it was; to which, on\r\n",
      "consulting his watch, he replied that it was three in the morning.\r\n",
      "This famous timepiece, always regulated on the Greenwich meridian,\r\n",
      "which was now some seventy-seven degrees westward, was at least four\r\n",
      "hours slow.  Sir Francis corrected Passepartout's time, whereupon the\r\n",
      "latter made the same remark that he had done to Fix; and upon the\r\n",
      "general insisting that the watch should be regulated in each new\r\n",
      "meridian, since he was constantly going eastward, that is in the face\r\n",
      "of the sun, and therefore the days were shorter by four minutes for\r\n",
      "each degree gone over, Passepartout obstinately refused to alter his\r\n",
      "watch, which he kept at London time.  It was an innocent delusion which\r\n",
      "could harm no one.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The train stopped, at eight o'clock, in the midst of a glade some\r\n",
      "fifteen miles beyond Rothal, where there were several bungalows, and\r\n",
      "workmen's cabins.  The conductor, passing along the carriages, shouted,\r\n",
      "\"Passengers will get out here!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Phileas Fogg looked at Sir Francis Cromarty for an explanation; but the\r\n",

      "dates and acacias.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout, not less surprised, rushed out and speedily returned,\r\n",
      "crying: \"Monsieur, no more railway!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do you mean?\" asked Sir Francis.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I mean to say that the train isn't going on.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The general at once stepped out, while Phileas Fogg calmly followed\r\n",
      "him, and they proceeded together to the conductor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where are we?\" asked Sir Francis.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"At the hamlet of Kholby.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do we stop here?\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"What! not finished?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No.  There's still a matter of fifty miles to be laid from here to\r\n",
      "Allahabad, where the line begins again.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But the papers announced the opening of the railway throughout.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What would you have, officer?  The papers were mistaken.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yet you sell tickets from Bombay to Calcutta,\" retorted Sir Francis,\r\n",
      "who was growing warm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No doubt,\" replied the conductor; \"but the passengers know that they\r\n",
      "must provide means of transportation for themselves from Kholby to\r\n",
      "Allahabad.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Francis was furious.  Passepartout would willingly have knocked the\r\n",
      "conductor down, and did not dare to look at his master.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sir Francis,\" said Mr. Fogg quietly, \"we will, if you please, look\r\n",
      "about for some means of conveyance to Allahabad.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mr. Fogg, this is a delay greatly to your disadvantage.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, Sir Francis; it was foreseen.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What!  You knew that the way--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not at all; but I knew that some obstacle or other would sooner or\r\n",
      "later arise on my route.  Nothing, therefore, is lost. I have two days,\r\n",
      "which I have already gained, to sacrifice.  A steamer leaves Calcutta\r\n",
      "for Hong Kong at noon, on the 25th.  This is the 22nd, and we shall\r\n",
      "reach Calcutta in time.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was nothing to say to so confident a response.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was but too true that the railway came to a termination at this\r\n",
      "point.  The papers were like some watches, which have a way of getting\r\n",
      "too fast, and had been premature in their announcement of the\r\n",
      "completion of the line.  The greater part of the travellers were aware\r\n",
      "of this interruption, and, leaving the train, they began to engage such\r\n",
      "vehicles as the village could provide four-wheeled palkigharis, waggons\r\n",
      "drawn by zebus, carriages that looked like perambulating pagodas,\r\n",
      "palanquins, ponies, and what not.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty, after searching the village from end\r\n",
      "to end, came back without having found anything.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I shall go afoot,\" said Phileas Fogg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout, who had now rejoined his master, made a wry grimace, as\r\n",
      "he thought of his magnificent, but too frail Indian shoes.  Happily he\r\n",
      "too had been looking about him, and, after a moment's hesitation, said,\r\n",
      "\"Monsieur, I think I have found a means of conveyance.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"An elephant!  An elephant that belongs to an Indian who lives but a\r\n",
      "hundred steps from here.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let's go and see the elephant,\" replied Mr. Fogg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They soon reached a small hut, near which, enclosed within some high\r\n",
      "palings, was the animal in question.  An Indian came out of the hut,\r\n",
      "and, at their request, conducted them within the enclosure.  The\r\n",
      "elephant, which its owner had reared, not for a beast of burden, but\r\n",
      "for warlike purposes, was half domesticated.  The Indian had begun\r\n",
      "already, by often irritating him, and feeding him every three months on\r\n",
      "sugar and butter, to impart to him a ferocity not in his nature, this\r\n",
      "method being often employed by those who train the Indian elephants for\r\n",
      "battle.  Happily, however, for Mr. Fogg, the animal's instruction in\r\n",
      "this direction had not gone far, and the elephant still preserved his\r\n",
      "natural gentleness.  Kiouni--this was the name of the beast--could\r\n",
      "doubtless travel rapidly for a long time, and, in default of any other\r\n",
      "means of conveyance, Mr. Fogg resolved to hire him.  But elephants are\r\n",
      "far from cheap in India, where they are becoming scarce, the males,\r\n",
      "which alone are suitable for circus shows, are much sought, especially\r\n",
      "as but few of them are domesticated.  When therefore Mr. Fogg proposed\r\n",
      "to the Indian to hire Kiouni, he refused point-blank.  Mr. Fogg\r\n",
      "persisted, offering the excessive sum of ten pounds an hour for the\r\n",
      "loan of the beast to Allahabad.  Refused.  Twenty pounds?  Refused\r\n",
      "also.  Forty pounds?  Still refused.  Passepartout jumped at each\r\n",
      "advance; but the Indian declined to be tempted.  Yet the offer was an\r\n",
      "alluring one, for, supposing it took the elephant fifteen hours to\r\n",
      "reach Allahabad, his owner would receive no less than six hundred\r\n",
      "pounds sterling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Phileas Fogg, without getting in the least flurried, then proposed to\r\n",
      "purchase the animal outright, and at first offered a thousand pounds\r\n",
      "for him.  The Indian, perhaps thinking he was going to make a great\r\n",
      "bargain, still refused.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Francis Cromarty took Mr. Fogg aside, and begged him to reflect\r\n",
      "before he went any further; to which that gentleman replied that he was\r\n",
      "not in the habit of acting rashly, that a bet of twenty thousand pounds\r\n",
      "was at stake, that the elephant was absolutely necessary to him, and\r\n",
      "that he would secure him if he had to pay twenty times his value.\r\n",
      "Returning to the Indian, whose small, sharp eyes, glistening with\r\n",
      "avarice, betrayed that with him it was only a question of how great a\r\n",
      "price he could obtain.  Mr. Fogg offered first twelve hundred, then\r\n",
      "fifteen hundred, eighteen hundred, two thousand pounds.  Passepartout,\r\n",
      "usually so rubicund, was fairly white with suspense.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At two thousand pounds the Indian yielded.\r\n",

      "young Parsee, with an intelligent face, offered his services, which Mr.\r\n",

      "stimulate his zeal.  The elephant was led out and equipped.  The\r\n",
      "Parsee, who was an accomplished elephant driver, covered his back with\r\n",
      "a sort of saddle-cloth, and attached to each of his flanks some\r\n",
      "curiously uncomfortable howdahs.  Phileas Fogg paid the Indian with\r\n",
      "some banknotes which he extracted from the famous carpet-bag, a\r\n",
      "proceeding that seemed to deprive poor Passepartout of his vitals.\r\n",

      "owing to the capricious turnings of the Vindhia Mountains, did not\r\n",

      "roads and paths in the district, declared that they would gain twenty\r\n",
      "miles by striking directly through the forest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty, plunged to the neck in the\r\n",

      "trotting of the elephant, spurred on as he was by the skilful Parsee;\r\n",

      "little, and scarcely able to catch a glimpse of each other.  As for\r\n",
      "Passepartout, who was mounted on the beast's back, and received the\r\n",
      "direct force of each concussion as he trod along, he was very careful,\r\n",
      "in accordance with his master's advice, to keep his tongue from between\r\n",
      "his teeth, as it would otherwise have been bitten off short.  The\r\n",
      "worthy fellow bounced from the elephant's neck to his rump, and vaulted\r\n",
      "like a clown on a spring-board; yet he laughed in the midst of his\r\n",
      "bouncing, and from time to time took a piece of sugar out of his\r\n",
      "pocket, and inserted it in Kiouni's trunk, who received it without in\r\n",
      "the least slackening his regular trot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After two hours the guide stopped the elephant, and gave him an hour\r\n",
      "for rest, during which Kiouni, after quenching his thirst at a\r\n",
      "neighbouring spring, set to devouring the branches and shrubs round\r\n",
      "about him.  Neither Sir Francis nor Mr. Fogg regretted the delay, and\r\n",
      "both descended with a feeling of relief.  \"Why, he's made of iron!\"\r\n",
      "exclaimed the general, gazing admiringly on Kiouni.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of forged iron,\" replied Passepartout, as he set about preparing a\r\n",
      "hasty breakfast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At noon the Parsee gave the signal of departure.  The country soon\r\n",
      "presented a very savage aspect.  Copses of dates and dwarf-palms\r\n",
      "succeeded the dense forests; then vast, dry plains, dotted with scanty\r\n",
      "shrubs, and sown with great blocks of syenite.  All this portion of\r\n",
      "Bundelcund, which is little frequented by travellers, is inhabited by a\r\n",
      "fanatical population, hardened in the most horrible practices of the\r\n",
      "Hindoo faith.  The English have not been able to secure complete\r\n",
      "dominion over this territory, which is subjected to the influence of\r\n",
      "rajahs, whom it is almost impossible to reach in their inaccessible\r\n",
      "mountain fastnesses. The travellers several times saw bands of\r\n",
      "ferocious Indians, who, when they perceived the elephant striding\r\n",
      "across-country, made angry and threatening motions.  The Parsee avoided\r\n",
      "them as much as possible.  Few animals were observed on the route; even\r\n",
      "the monkeys hurried from their path with contortions and grimaces which\r\n",
      "convulsed Passepartout with laughter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the midst of his gaiety, however, one thought troubled the worthy\r\n",
      "servant.  What would Mr. Fogg do with the elephant when he got to\r\n",
      "Allahabad?  Would he carry him on with him?  Impossible!  The cost of\r\n",
      "transporting him would make him ruinously expensive.  Would he sell\r\n",
      "him, or set him free?  The estimable beast certainly deserved some\r\n",
      "consideration.  Should Mr. Fogg choose to make him, Passepartout, a\r\n",
      "present of Kiouni, he would be very much embarrassed; and these\r\n",
      "thoughts did not cease worrying him for a long time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The principal chain of the Vindhias was crossed by eight in the\r\n",
      "evening, and another halt was made on the northern slope, in a ruined\r\n",
      "bungalow.  They had gone nearly twenty-five miles that day, and an\r\n",
      "equal distance still separated them from the station of Allahabad.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The night was cold.  The Parsee lit a fire in the bungalow with a few\r\n",
      "dry branches, and the warmth was very grateful, provisions purchased at\r\n",
      "Kholby sufficed for supper, and the travellers ate ravenously.  The\r\n",
      "conversation, beginning with a few disconnected phrases, soon gave\r\n",
      "place to loud and steady snores.  The guide watched Kiouni, who slept\r\n",
      "standing, bolstering himself against the trunk of a large tree.\r\n",
      "Nothing occurred during the night to disturb the slumberers, although\r\n",
      "occasional growls from panthers and chatterings of monkeys broke the\r\n",
      "silence; the more formidable beasts made no cries or hostile\r\n",
      "demonstration against the occupants of the bungalow.  Sir Francis slept\r\n",
      "heavily, like an honest soldier overcome with fatigue.  Passepartout\r\n",
      "was wrapped in uneasy dreams of the bouncing of the day before.  As for\r\n",
      "Mr. Fogg, he slumbered as peacefully as if he had been in his serene\r\n",
      "mansion in Saville Row.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The journey was resumed at six in the morning; the guide hoped to reach\r\n",
      "Allahabad by evening.  In that case, Mr. Fogg would only lose a part of\r\n",
      "the forty-eight hours saved since the beginning of the tour.  Kiouni,\r\n",
      "resuming his rapid gait, soon descended the lower spurs of the\r\n",
      "Vindhias, and towards noon they passed by the village of Kallenger, on\r\n",
      "the Cani, one of the branches of the Ganges.  The guide avoided\r\n",
      "inhabited places, thinking it safer to keep the open country, which\r\n",
      "lies along the first depressions of the basin of the great river.\r\n",
      "Allahabad was now only twelve miles to the north-east.  They stopped\r\n",
      "under a clump of bananas, the fruit of which, as healthy as bread and\r\n",
      "as succulent as cream, was amply partaken of and appreciated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At two o'clock the guide entered a thick forest which extended several\r\n",
      "miles; he preferred to travel under cover of the woods.  They had not\r\n",
      "as yet had any unpleasant encounters, and the journey seemed on the\r\n",
      "point of being successfully accomplished, when the elephant, becoming\r\n",
      "restless, suddenly stopped.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was then four o'clock.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What's the matter?\" asked Sir Francis, putting out his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't know, officer,\" replied the Parsee, listening attentively to a\r\n",
      "confused murmur which came through the thick branches.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The murmur soon became more distinct; it now seemed like a distant\r\n",
      "concert of human voices accompanied by brass instruments.  Passepartout\r\n",
      "was all eyes and ears.  Mr. Fogg patiently waited without a word.  The\r\n",
      "Parsee jumped to the ground, fastened the elephant to a tree, and\r\n",
      "plunged into the thicket.  He soon returned, saying:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A procession of Brahmins is coming this way.  We must prevent their\r\n",
      "seeing us, if possible.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The guide unloosed the elephant and led him into a thicket, at the same\r\n",
      "time asking the travellers not to stir.  He held himself ready to\r\n",
      "bestride the animal at a moment's notice, should flight become\r\n",
      "necessary; but he evidently thought that the procession of the faithful\r\n",
      "would pass without perceiving them amid the thick foliage, in which\r\n",
      "they were wholly concealed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The discordant tones of the voices and instruments drew nearer, and now\r\n",
      "droning songs mingled with the sound of the tambourines and cymbals.\r\n",
      "The head of the procession soon appeared beneath the trees, a hundred\r\n",
      "paces away; and the strange figures who performed the religious\r\n",
      "ceremony were easily distinguished through the branches.  First came\r\n",
      "the priests, with mitres on their heads, and clothed in long lace\r\n",
      "robes.  They were surrounded by men, women, and children, who sang a\r\n",
      "kind of lugubrious psalm, interrupted at regular intervals by the\r\n",
      "tambourines and cymbals; while behind them was drawn a car with large\r\n",
      "wheels, the spokes of which represented serpents entwined with each\r\n",
      "other.  Upon the car, which was drawn by four richly caparisoned zebus,\r\n",
      "stood a hideous statue with four arms, the body coloured a dull red,\r\n",
      "with haggard eyes, dishevelled hair, protruding tongue, and lips tinted\r\n",
      "with betel.  It stood upright upon the figure of a prostrate and\r\n",
      "headless giant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Francis, recognising the statue, whispered, \"The goddess Kali; the\r\n",
      "goddess of love and death.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of death, perhaps,\" muttered back Passepartout, \"but of love--that\r\n",
      "ugly old hag?  Never!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Parsee made a motion to keep silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A group of old fakirs were capering and making a wild ado round the\r\n",
      "statue; these were striped with ochre, and covered with cuts whence\r\n",
      "their blood issued drop by drop--stupid fanatics, who, in the great\r\n",
      "Indian ceremonies, still throw themselves under the wheels of\r\n",
      "Juggernaut.  Some Brahmins, clad in all the sumptuousness of Oriental\r\n",
      "apparel, and leading a woman who faltered at every step, followed.\r\n",
      "This woman was young, and as fair as a European.  Her head and neck,\r\n",
      "shoulders, ears, arms, hands, and toes were loaded down with jewels and\r\n",
      "gems with bracelets, earrings, and rings; while a tunic bordered with\r\n",
      "gold, and covered with a light muslin robe, betrayed the outline of her\r\n",
      "form.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The guards who followed the young woman presented a violent contrast to\r\n",
      "her, armed as they were with naked sabres hung at their waists, and\r\n",
      "long damascened pistols, and bearing a corpse on a palanquin.  It was\r\n",
      "the body of an old man, gorgeously arrayed in the habiliments of a\r\n",
      "rajah, wearing, as in life, a turban embroidered with pearls, a robe of\r\n",
      "tissue of silk and gold, a scarf of cashmere sewed with diamonds, and\r\n",
      "the magnificent weapons of a Hindoo prince.  Next came the musicians\r\n",
      "and a rearguard of capering fakirs, whose cries sometimes drowned the\r\n",
      "noise of the instruments; these closed the procession.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Francis watched the procession with a sad countenance, and, turning\r\n",
      "to the guide, said, \"A suttee.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Parsee nodded, and put his finger to his lips.  The procession\r\n",
      "slowly wound under the trees, and soon its last ranks disappeared in\r\n",
      "the depths of the wood.  The songs gradually died away; occasionally\r\n",
      "cries were heard in the distance, until at last all was silence again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Phileas Fogg had heard what Sir Francis said, and, as soon as the\r\n",
      "procession had disappeared, asked: \"What is a suttee?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A suttee,\" returned the general, \"is a human sacrifice, but a\r\n",
      "voluntary one.  The woman you have just seen will be burned to-morrow\r\n",
      "at the dawn of day.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, the scoundrels!\" cried Passepartout, who could not repress his\r\n",
      "indignation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And the corpse?\" asked Mr. Fogg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is that of the prince, her husband,\" said the guide; \"an independent\r\n",
      "rajah of Bundelcund.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is it possible,\" resumed Phileas Fogg, his voice betraying not the\r\n",
      "least emotion, \"that these barbarous customs still exist in India, and\r\n",
      "that the English have been unable to put a stop to them?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"These sacrifices do not occur in the larger portion of India,\" replied\r\n",
      "Sir Francis; \"but we have no power over these savage territories, and\r\n",
      "especially here in Bundelcund.  The whole district north of the\r\n",
      "Vindhias is the theatre of incessant murders and pillage.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The poor wretch!\" exclaimed Passepartout, \"to be burned alive!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" returned Sir Francis, \"burned alive.  And, if she were not, you\r\n",
      "cannot conceive what treatment she would be obliged to submit to from\r\n",
      "her relatives.  They would shave off her hair, feed her on a scanty\r\n",
      "allowance of rice, treat her with contempt; she would be looked upon as\r\n",
      "an unclean creature, and would die in some corner, like a scurvy dog.\r\n",
      "The prospect of so frightful an existence drives these poor creatures\r\n",
      "to the sacrifice much more than love or religious fanaticism.\r\n",
      "Sometimes, however, the sacrifice is really voluntary, and it requires\r\n",
      "the active interference of the Government to prevent it.  Several years\r\n",
      "ago, when I was living at Bombay, a young widow asked permission of the\r\n",
      "governor to be burned along with her husband's body; but, as you may\r\n",
      "imagine, he refused.  The woman left the town, took refuge with an\r\n",
      "independent rajah, and there carried out her self-devoted purpose.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While Sir Francis was speaking, the guide shook his head several times,\r\n",
      "and now said: \"The sacrifice which will take place to-morrow at dawn is\r\n",
      "not a voluntary one.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How do you know?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Everybody knows about this affair in Bundelcund.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But the wretched creature did not seem to be making any resistance,\"\r\n",
      "observed Sir Francis.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That was because they had intoxicated her with fumes of hemp and\r\n",
      "opium.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But where are they taking her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To the pagoda of Pillaji, two miles from here; she will pass the night\r\n",
      "there.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And the sacrifice will take place--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To-morrow, at the first light of dawn.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The guide now led the elephant out of the thicket, and leaped upon his\r\n",
      "neck.  Just at the moment that he was about to urge Kiouni forward with\r\n",
      "a peculiar whistle, Mr. Fogg stopped him, and, turning to Sir Francis\r\n",

      "young woman was imprisoned.  Could they enter any of its doors while\r\n",
      "the whole party of Indians was plunged in a drunken sleep, or was it\r\n",
      "safer to attempt to make a hole in the walls?  This could only be\r\n",
      "determined at the moment and the place themselves; but it was certain\r\n",
      "that the abduction must be made that night, and not when, at break of\r\n",
      "day, the victim was led to her funeral pyre.  Then no human\r\n",
      "intervention could save her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As soon as night fell, about six o'clock, they decided to make a\r\n",
      "reconnaissance around the pagoda.  The cries of the fakirs were just\r\n",
      "ceasing; the Indians were in the act of plunging themselves into the\r\n",
      "drunkenness caused by liquid opium mingled with hemp, and it might be\r\n",
      "possible to slip between them to the temple itself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Parsee, leading the others, noiselessly crept through the wood, and\r\n",
      "in ten minutes they found themselves on the banks of a small stream,\r\n",
      "whence, by the light of the rosin torches, they perceived a pyre of\r\n",
      "wood, on the top of which lay the embalmed body of the rajah, which was\r\n",
      "to be burned with his wife.  The pagoda, whose minarets loomed above\r\n",
      "the trees in the deepening dusk, stood a hundred steps away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come!\" whispered the guide.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He slipped more cautiously than ever through the brush, followed by his\r\n",
      "companions; the silence around was only broken by the low murmuring of\r\n",
      "the wind among the branches.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Soon the Parsee stopped on the borders of the glade, which was lit up\r\n",
      "by the torches.  The ground was covered by groups of the Indians,\r\n",
      "motionless in their drunken sleep; it seemed a battlefield strewn with\r\n",
      "the dead.  Men, women, and children lay together.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the background, among the trees, the pagoda of Pillaji loomed\r\n",
      "distinctly.  Much to the guide's disappointment, the guards of the\r\n",
      "rajah, lighted by torches, were watching at the doors and marching to\r\n",
      "and fro with naked sabres; probably the priests, too, were watching\r\n",
      "within.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Parsee, now convinced that it was impossible to force an entrance\r\n",
      "to the temple, advanced no farther, but led his companions back again.\r\n",
      "Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty also saw that nothing could be\r\n",
      "attempted in that direction.  They stopped, and engaged in a whispered\r\n",
      "colloquy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It is only eight now,\" said the brigadier, \"and these guards may also\r\n",
      "go to sleep.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It is not impossible,\" returned the Parsee.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They lay down at the foot of a tree, and waited.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The time seemed long; the guide ever and anon left them to take an\r\n",
      "observation on the edge of the wood, but the guards watched steadily by\r\n",
      "the glare of the torches, and a dim light crept through the windows of\r\n",
      "the pagoda.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They waited till midnight; but no change took place among the guards,\r\n",
      "and it became apparent that their yielding to sleep could not be\r\n",
      "counted on.  The other plan must be carried out; an opening in the\r\n",
      "walls of the pagoda must be made.  It remained to ascertain whether the\r\n",
      "priests were watching by the side of their victim as assiduously as\r\n",
      "were the soldiers at the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After a last consultation, the guide announced that he was ready for\r\n",
      "the attempt, and advanced, followed by the others.  They took a\r\n",
      "roundabout way, so as to get at the pagoda on the rear.  They reached\r\n",
      "the walls about half-past twelve, without having met anyone; here there\r\n",
      "was no guard, nor were there either windows or doors.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The night was dark.  The moon, on the wane, scarcely left the horizon,\r\n",
      "and was covered with heavy clouds; the height of the trees deepened the\r\n",
      "darkness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was not enough to reach the walls; an opening in them must be\r\n",
      "accomplished, and to attain this purpose the party only had their\r\n",
      "pocket-knives.  Happily the temple walls were built of brick and wood,\r\n",
      "which could be penetrated with little difficulty; after one brick had\r\n",
      "been taken out, the rest would yield easily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They set noiselessly to work, and the Parsee on one side and\r\n",
      "Passepartout on the other began to loosen the bricks so as to make an\r\n",
      "aperture two feet wide.  They were getting on rapidly, when suddenly a\r\n",
      "cry was heard in the interior of the temple, followed almost instantly\r\n",
      "by other cries replying from the outside.  Passepartout and the guide\r\n",
      "stopped.  Had they been heard?  Was the alarm being given?  Common\r\n",
      "prudence urged them to retire, and they did so, followed by Phileas\r\n",
      "Fogg and Sir Francis.  They again hid themselves in the wood, and\r\n",
      "waited till the disturbance, whatever it might be, ceased, holding\r\n",
      "themselves ready to resume their attempt without delay.  But, awkwardly\r\n",
      "enough, the guards now appeared at the rear of the temple, and there\r\n",
      "installed themselves, in readiness to prevent a surprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It would be difficult to describe the disappointment of the party, thus\r\n",
      "interrupted in their work.  They could not now reach the victim; how,\r\n",
      "then, could they save her?  Sir Francis shook his fists, Passepartout\r\n",
      "was beside himself, and the guide gnashed his teeth with rage.  The\r\n",
      "tranquil Fogg waited, without betraying any emotion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We have nothing to do but to go away,\" whispered Sir Francis.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nothing but to go away,\" echoed the guide.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Stop,\" said Fogg.  \"I am only due at Allahabad tomorrow before noon.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But what can you hope to do?\" asked Sir Francis.  \"In a few hours it\r\n",
      "will be daylight, and--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The chance which now seems lost may present itself at the last moment.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Francis would have liked to read Phileas Fogg's eyes.  What was\r\n",
      "this cool Englishman thinking of?  Was he planning to make a rush for\r\n",
      "the young woman at the very moment of the sacrifice, and boldly snatch\r\n",
      "her from her executioners?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This would be utter folly, and it was hard to admit that Fogg was such\r\n",
      "a fool.  Sir Francis consented, however, to remain to the end of this\r\n",
      "terrible drama.  The guide led them to the rear of the glade, where\r\n",
      "they were able to observe the sleeping groups.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile Passepartout, who had perched himself on the lower branches\r\n",
      "of a tree, was resolving an idea which had at first struck him like a\r\n",
      "flash, and which was now firmly lodged in his brain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had commenced by saying to himself, \"What folly!\" and then he\r\n",
      "repeated, \"Why not, after all?  It's a chance,--perhaps the only one; and\r\n",
      "with such sots!\" Thinking thus, he slipped, with the suppleness of a\r\n",
      "serpent, to the lowest branches, the ends of which bent almost to the\r\n",
      "ground.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The hours passed, and the lighter shades now announced the approach of\r\n",
      "day, though it was not yet light.  This was the moment.  The slumbering\r\n",
      "multitude became animated, the tambourines sounded, songs and cries\r\n",
      "arose; the hour of the sacrifice had come.  The doors of the pagoda\r\n",
      "swung open, and a bright light escaped from its interior, in the midst\r\n",
      "of which Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis espied the victim.  She seemed,\r\n",
      "having shaken off the stupor of intoxication, to be striving to escape\r\n",
      "from her executioner.  Sir Francis's heart throbbed; and, convulsively\r\n",
      "seizing Mr. Fogg's hand, found in it an open knife.  Just at this\r\n",
      "moment the crowd began to move.  The young woman had again fallen into\r\n",
      "a stupor caused by the fumes of hemp, and passed among the fakirs, who\r\n",
      "escorted her with their wild, religious cries.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Phileas Fogg and his companions, mingling in the rear ranks of the\r\n",
      "crowd, followed; and in two minutes they reached the banks of the\r\n",
      "stream, and stopped fifty paces from the pyre, upon which still lay the\r\n",
      "rajah's corpse.  In the semi-obscurity they saw the victim, quite\r\n",
      "senseless, stretched out beside her husband's body. Then a torch was\r\n",
      "brought, and the wood, heavily soaked with oil, instantly took fire.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this moment Sir Francis and the guide seized Phileas Fogg, who, in\r\n",
      "an instant of mad generosity, was about to rush upon the pyre.  But he\r\n",
      "had quickly pushed them aside, when the whole scene suddenly changed.\r\n",
      "A cry of terror arose.  The whole multitude prostrated themselves,\r\n",
      "terror-stricken, on the ground.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old rajah was not dead, then, since he rose of a sudden, like a\r\n",
      "spectre, took up his wife in his arms, and descended from the pyre in\r\n",
      "the midst of the clouds of smoke, which only heightened his ghostly\r\n",
      "appearance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fakirs and soldiers and priests, seized with instant terror, lay there,\r\n",
      "with their faces on the ground, not daring to lift their eyes and\r\n",
      "behold such a prodigy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The inanimate victim was borne along by the vigorous arms which\r\n",
      "supported her, and which she did not seem in the least to burden.  Mr.\r\n",
      "Fogg and Sir Francis stood erect, the Parsee bowed his head, and\r\n",
      "Passepartout was, no doubt, scarcely less stupefied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The resuscitated rajah approached Sir Francis and Mr. Fogg, and, in an\r\n",
      "abrupt tone, said, \"Let us be off!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was Passepartout himself, who had slipped upon the pyre in the midst\r\n",
      "of the smoke and, profiting by the still overhanging darkness, had\r\n",
      "delivered the young woman from death!  It was Passepartout who, playing\r\n",
      "his part with a happy audacity, had passed through the crowd amid the\r\n",
      "general terror.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A moment after all four of the party had disappeared in the woods, and\r\n",
      "the elephant was bearing them away at a rapid pace. But the cries and\r\n",
      "noise, and a ball which whizzed through Phileas Fogg's hat, apprised\r\n",
      "them that the trick had been discovered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old rajah's body, indeed, now appeared upon the burning pyre; and\r\n",
      "the priests, recovered from their terror, perceived that an abduction\r\n",
      "had taken place.  They hastened into the forest, followed by the\r\n",
      "soldiers, who fired a volley after the fugitives; but the latter\r\n",
      "rapidly increased the distance between them, and ere long found\r\n",
      "themselves beyond the reach of the bullets and arrows.\r\n",

      "seven o'clock, the young woman being still in a state of complete\r\n",
      "prostration.  The guide made her drink a little brandy and water, but\r\n",
      "the drowsiness which stupefied her could not yet be shaken off.  Sir\r\n",
      "Francis, who was familiar with the effects of the intoxication produced\r\n",
      "by the fumes of hemp, reassured his companions on her account.  But he\r\n",
      "was more disturbed at the prospect of her future fate.  He told Phileas\r\n",

      "scattered throughout the county, and would, despite the English police,\r\n",
      "recover their victim at Madras, Bombay, or Calcutta.  She would only be\r\n",
      "safe by quitting India for ever.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Phileas Fogg replied that he would reflect upon the matter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The station at Allahabad was reached about ten o'clock, and, the\r\n",
      "interrupted line of railway being resumed, would enable them to reach\r\n",

      "articles of toilet, a dress, shawl, and some furs; for which his master\r\n",
      "gave him unlimited credit.  Passepartout started off forthwith, and\r\n",
      "found himself in the streets of Allahabad, that is, the City of God,\r\n",
      "one of the most venerated in India, being built at the junction of the\r\n",
      "two sacred rivers, Ganges and Jumna, the waters of which attract\r\n",
      "pilgrims from every part of the peninsula.  The Ganges, according to\r\n",

      "agency, it descends to the earth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout made it a point, as he made his purchases, to take a good\r\n",

      "promised them a goodly sum in damages, and sent them forward to\r\n",
      "Calcutta by the next train.  Owing to the delay caused by the rescue of\r\n",

      "when he learned that Phileas Fogg had not made his appearance in\r\n",
      "Calcutta may be imagined.  He made up his mind that the robber had\r\n",
      "stopped somewhere on the route and taken refuge in the southern\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Inasmuch,\" resumed the judge, \"as the English law protects equally and\r\n",
      "sternly the religions of the Indian people, and as the man Passepartout\r\n",
      "has admitted that he violated the sacred pagoda of Malabar Hill, at\r\n",
      "Bombay, on the 20th of October, I condemn the said Passepartout to\r\n",
      "imprisonment for fifteen days and a fine of three hundred pounds.\"\r\n",

      "\"Three hundred pounds!\" cried Passepartout, startled at the largeness\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Silence!\" shouted the constable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And inasmuch,\" continued the judge, \"as it is not proved that the act\r\n",
      "was not done by the connivance of the master with the servant, and as\r\n",
      "the master in any case must be held responsible for the acts of his\r\n",
      "paid servant, I condemn Phileas Fogg to a week's imprisonment and a\r\n",
      "fine of one hundred and fifty pounds.\"\r\n",

      "detained in Calcutta a week, it would be more than time for the warrant\r\n",
      "to arrive.  Passepartout was stupefied.  This sentence ruined his\r\n",
      "master.  A wager of twenty thousand pounds lost, because he, like a\r\n",
      "precious fool, had gone into that abominable pagoda!\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "concern him, did not even lift his eyebrows while it was being\r\n",
      "pronounced.  Just as the clerk was calling the next case, he rose, and\r\n",
      "said, \"I offer bail.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You have that right,\" returned the judge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fix's blood ran cold, but he resumed his composure when he heard the\r\n",
      "judge announce that the bail required for each prisoner would be one\r\n",
      "thousand pounds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I will pay it at once,\" said Mr. Fogg, taking a roll of bank-bills\r\n",
      "from the carpet-bag, which Passepartout had by him, and placing them on\r\n",
      "the clerk's desk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This sum will be restored to you upon your release from prison,\" said\r\n",
      "the judge.  \"Meanwhile, you are liberated on bail.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come!\" said Phileas Fogg to his servant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But let them at least give me back my shoes!\" cried Passepartout\r\n",
      "angrily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah, these are pretty dear shoes!\" he muttered, as they were handed to\r\n",
      "him.  \"More than a thousand pounds apiece; besides, they pinch my feet.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Fogg, offering his arm to Aouda, then departed, followed by the\r\n",
      "crestfallen Passepartout.  Fix still nourished hopes that the robber\r\n",
      "would not, after all, leave the two thousand pounds behind him, but\r\n",
      "would decide to serve out his week in jail, and issued forth on Mr.\r\n",

      "landed on one of the quays.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Rangoon was moored half a mile off in the harbour, its signal of\r\n",

      "and push off in a boat for the steamer, and stamped his feet with\r\n",
      "disappointment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The rascal is off, after all!\" he exclaimed.  \"Two thousand pounds\r\n",

      "miles, occupying from ten to twelve days, and the young woman was not\r\n",
      "difficult to please.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "During the first days of the journey Aouda became better acquainted\r\n",
      "with her protector, and constantly gave evidence of her deep gratitude\r\n",
      "for what he had done.  The phlegmatic gentleman listened to her,\r\n",
      "apparently at least, with coldness, neither his voice nor his manner\r\n",
      "betraying the slightest emotion; but he seemed to be always on the\r\n",
      "watch that nothing should be wanting to Aouda's comfort.  He visited\r\n",
      "her regularly each day at certain hours, not so much to talk himself,\r\n",
      "as to sit and hear her talk.  He treated her with the strictest\r\n",
      "politeness, but with the precision of an automaton, the movements of\r\n",
      "which had been arranged for this purpose.  Aouda did not quite know\r\n",
      "what to make of him, though Passepartout had given her some hints of\r\n",
      "his master's eccentricity, and made her smile by telling her of the\r\n",
      "wager which was sending him round the world.  After all, she owed\r\n",
      "Phileas Fogg her life, and she always regarded him through the exalting\r\n",
      "medium of her gratitude.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Aouda confirmed the Parsee guide's narrative of her touching history.\r\n",
      "She did, indeed, belong to the highest of the native races of India.\r\n",
      "Many of the Parsee merchants have made great fortunes there by dealing\r\n",
      "in cotton; and one of them, Sir Jametsee Jeejeebhoy, was made a baronet\r\n",
      "by the English government.  Aouda was a relative of this great man, and\r\n",
      "it was his cousin, Jeejeeh, whom she hoped to join at Hong Kong.\r\n",
      "Whether she would find a protector in him she could not tell; but Mr.\r\n",
      "Fogg essayed to calm her anxieties, and to assure her that everything\r\n",
      "would be mathematically--he used the very word--arranged.  Aouda\r\n",
      "fastened her great eyes, \"clear as the sacred lakes of the Himalaya,\"\r\n",
      "upon him; but the intractable Fogg, as reserved as ever, did not seem\r\n",
      "at all inclined to throw himself into this lake.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first few days of the voyage passed prosperously, amid favourable\r\n",
      "weather and propitious winds, and they soon came in sight of the great\r\n",
      "Andaman, the principal of the islands in the Bay of Bengal, with its\r\n",
      "picturesque Saddle Peak, two thousand four hundred feet high, looming\r\n",
      "above the waters.  The steamer passed along near the shores, but the\r\n",
      "savage Papuans, who are in the lowest scale of humanity, but are not,\r\n",
      "as has been asserted, cannibals, did not make their appearance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The panorama of the islands, as they steamed by them, was superb.  Vast\r\n",
      "forests of palms, arecs, bamboo, teakwood, of the gigantic mimosa, and\r\n",
      "tree-like ferns covered the foreground, while behind, the graceful\r\n",
      "outlines of the mountains were traced against the sky; and along the\r\n",
      "coasts swarmed by thousands the precious swallows whose nests furnish a\r\n",
      "luxurious dish to the tables of the Celestial Empire.  The varied\r\n",
      "landscape afforded by the Andaman Islands was soon passed, however, and\r\n",
      "the Rangoon rapidly approached the Straits of Malacca, which gave\r\n",
      "access to the China seas.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What was detective Fix, so unluckily drawn on from country to country,\r\n",
      "doing all this while?  He had managed to embark on the Rangoon at\r\n",
      "Calcutta without being seen by Passepartout, after leaving orders that,\r\n",
      "if the warrant should arrive, it should be forwarded to him at Hong\r\n",
      "Kong; and he hoped to conceal his presence to the end of the voyage.\r\n",
      "It would have been difficult to explain why he was on board without\r\n",
      "awakening Passepartout's suspicions, who thought him still at Bombay.\r\n",
      "But necessity impelled him, nevertheless, to renew his acquaintance\r\n",
      "with the worthy servant, as will be seen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All the detective's hopes and wishes were now centred on Hong Kong; for\r\n",
      "the steamer's stay at Singapore would be too brief to enable him to\r\n",
      "take any steps there.  The arrest must be made at Hong Kong, or the\r\n",
      "robber would probably escape him for ever.  Hong Kong was the last\r\n",
      "English ground on which he would set foot; beyond, China, Japan,\r\n",
      "America offered to Fogg an almost certain refuge.  If the warrant\r\n",
      "should at last make its appearance at Hong Kong, Fix could arrest him\r\n",
      "and give him into the hands of the local police, and there would be no\r\n",
      "further trouble.  But beyond Hong Kong, a simple warrant would be of no\r\n",
      "avail; an extradition warrant would be necessary, and that would result\r\n",
      "in delays and obstacles, of which the rascal would take advantage to\r\n",
      "elude justice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fix thought over these probabilities during the long hours which he\r\n",
      "spent in his cabin, and kept repeating to himself, \"Now, either the\r\n",
      "warrant will be at Hong Kong, in which case I shall arrest my man, or\r\n",
      "it will not be there; and this time it is absolutely necessary that I\r\n",
      "should delay his departure.  I have failed at Bombay, and I have failed\r\n",
      "at Calcutta; if I fail at Hong Kong, my reputation is lost:  Cost what\r\n",
      "it may, I must succeed!  But how shall I prevent his departure, if that\r\n",
      "should turn out to be my last resource?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fix made up his mind that, if worst came to worst, he would make a\r\n",
      "confidant of Passepartout, and tell him what kind of a fellow his\r\n",
      "master really was.  That Passepartout was not Fogg's accomplice, he was\r\n",
      "very certain.  The servant, enlightened by his disclosure, and afraid\r\n",
      "of being himself implicated in the crime, would doubtless become an\r\n",
      "ally of the detective.  But this method was a dangerous one, only to be\r\n",
      "employed when everything else had failed.  A word from Passepartout to\r\n",
      "his master would ruin all.  The detective was therefore in a sore\r\n",
      "strait.  But suddenly a new idea struck him.  The presence of Aouda on\r\n",
      "the Rangoon, in company with Phileas Fogg, gave him new material for\r\n",
      "reflection.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Who was this woman?  What combination of events had made her Fogg's\r\n",
      "travelling companion?  They had evidently met somewhere between Bombay\r\n",
      "and Calcutta; but where?  Had they met accidentally, or had Fogg gone\r\n",
      "into the interior purposely in quest of this charming damsel?  Fix was\r\n",
      "fairly puzzled.  He asked himself whether there had not been a wicked\r\n",
      "elopement; and this idea so impressed itself upon his mind that he\r\n",
      "determined to make use of the supposed intrigue.  Whether the young\r\n",
      "woman were married or not, he would be able to create such difficulties\r\n",
      "for Mr. Fogg at Hong Kong that he could not escape by paying any amount\r\n",
      "of money.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But could he even wait till they reached Hong Kong?  Fogg had an\r\n",
      "abominable way of jumping from one boat to another, and, before\r\n",
      "anything could be effected, might get full under way again for Yokohama.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fix decided that he must warn the English authorities, and signal the\r\n",
      "Rangoon before her arrival.  This was easy to do, since the steamer\r\n",
      "stopped at Singapore, whence there is a telegraphic wire to Hong Kong.\r\n",
      "He finally resolved, moreover, before acting more positively, to\r\n",
      "question Passepartout.  It would not be difficult to make him talk;\r\n",
      "and, as there was no time to lose, Fix prepared to make himself known.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was now the 30th of October, and on the following day the Rangoon\r\n",
      "was due at Singapore.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fix emerged from his cabin and went on deck.  Passepartout was\r\n",
      "promenading up and down in the forward part of the steamer.  The\r\n",
      "detective rushed forward with every appearance of extreme surprise, and\r\n",
      "exclaimed, \"You here, on the Rangoon?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What, Monsieur Fix, are you on board?\" returned the really astonished\r\n",
      "Passepartout, recognising his crony of the Mongolia.  \"Why, I left you\r\n",
      "at Bombay, and here you are, on the way to Hong Kong!  Are you going\r\n",
      "round the world too?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, no,\" replied Fix; \"I shall stop at Hong Kong--at least for some\r\n",
      "days.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hum!\" said Passepartout, who seemed for an instant perplexed.  \"But\r\n",
      "how is it I have not seen you on board since we left Calcutta?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, a trifle of sea-sickness--I've been staying in my berth.  The Gulf\r\n",
      "of Bengal does not agree with me as well as the Indian Ocean.  And how\r\n",
      "is Mr. Fogg?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"As well and as punctual as ever, not a day behind time!  But, Monsieur\r\n",
      "Fix, you don't know that we have a young lady with us.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A young lady?\" replied the detective, not seeming to comprehend what\r\n",
      "was said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout thereupon recounted Aouda's history, the affair at the\r\n",
      "Bombay pagoda, the purchase of the elephant for two thousand pounds,\r\n",
      "the rescue, the arrest, and sentence of the Calcutta court, and the\r\n",
      "restoration of Mr. Fogg and himself to liberty on bail.  Fix, who was\r\n",
      "familiar with the last events, seemed to be equally ignorant of all\r\n",
      "that Passepartout related; and the later was charmed to find so\r\n",
      "interested a listener.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But does your master propose to carry this young woman to Europe?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not at all.  We are simply going to place her under the protection of\r\n",
      "one of her relatives, a rich merchant at Hong Kong.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nothing to be done there,\" said Fix to himself, concealing his\r\n",
      "disappointment.  \"A glass of gin, Mr. Passepartout?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Willingly, Monsieur Fix.  We must at least have a friendly glass on\r\n",
      "board the Rangoon.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The detective and Passepartout met often on deck after this interview,\r\n",
      "though Fix was reserved, and did not attempt to induce his companion to\r\n",
      "divulge any more facts concerning Mr. Fogg.  He caught a glimpse of\r\n",
      "that mysterious gentleman once or twice; but Mr. Fogg usually confined\r\n",
      "himself to the cabin, where he kept Aouda company, or, according to his\r\n",
      "inveterate habit, took a hand at whist.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout began very seriously to conjecture what strange chance\r\n",
      "kept Fix still on the route that his master was pursuing.  It was\r\n",
      "really worth considering why this certainly very amiable and complacent\r\n",
      "person, whom he had first met at Suez, had then encountered on board\r\n",
      "the Mongolia, who disembarked at Bombay, which he announced as his\r\n",
      "destination, and now turned up so unexpectedly on the Rangoon, was\r\n",
      "following Mr. Fogg's tracks step by step.  What was Fix's object?\r\n",
      "Passepartout was ready to wager his Indian shoes--which he religiously\r\n",
      "preserved--that Fix would also leave Hong Kong at the same time with\r\n",
      "them, and probably on the same steamer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout might have cudgelled his brain for a century without\r\n",
      "hitting upon the real object which the detective had in view.  He never\r\n",
      "could have imagined that Phileas Fogg was being tracked as a robber\r\n",
      "around the globe.  But, as it is in human nature to attempt the\r\n",
      "solution of every mystery, Passepartout suddenly discovered an\r\n",
      "explanation of Fix's movements, which was in truth far from\r\n",
      "unreasonable.  Fix, he thought, could only be an agent of Mr. Fogg's\r\n",
      "friends at the Reform Club, sent to follow him up, and to ascertain\r\n",
      "that he really went round the world as had been agreed upon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's clear!\" repeated the worthy servant to himself, proud of his\r\n",
      "shrewdness.  \"He's a spy sent to keep us in view!  That isn't quite the\r\n",
      "thing, either, to be spying Mr. Fogg, who is so honourable a man!  Ah,\r\n",
      "gentlemen of the Reform, this shall cost you dear!\"\r\n",

      "his master, lest he should be justly offended at this mistrust on the\r\n",
      "part of his adversaries.  But he determined to chaff Fix, when he had\r\n",
      "the chance, with mysterious allusions, which, however, need not betray\r\n",
      "his real suspicions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "During the afternoon of Wednesday, 30th October, the Rangoon entered\r\n",
      "the Strait of Malacca, which separates the peninsula of that name from\r\n",
      "Sumatra.  The mountainous and craggy islets intercepted the beauties of\r\n",
      "this noble island from the view of the travellers.  The Rangoon weighed\r\n",
      "anchor at Singapore the next day at four a.m., to receive coal, having\r\n",
      "gained half a day on the prescribed time of her arrival.  Phileas Fogg\r\n",
      "noted this gain in his journal, and then, accompanied by Aouda, who\r\n",
      "betrayed a desire for a walk on shore, disembarked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fix, who suspected Mr. Fogg's every movement, followed them cautiously,\r\n",
      "without being himself perceived; while Passepartout, laughing in his\r\n",
      "sleeve at Fix's manoeuvres, went about his usual errands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The island of Singapore is not imposing in aspect, for there are no\r\n",
      "mountains; yet its appearance is not without attractions.  It is a park\r\n",
      "checkered by pleasant highways and avenues.  A handsome carriage, drawn\r\n",
      "by a sleek pair of New Holland horses, carried Phileas Fogg and Aouda\r\n",
      "into the midst of rows of palms with brilliant foliage, and of\r\n",
      "clove-trees, whereof the cloves form the heart of a half-open flower.\r\n",
      "Pepper plants replaced the prickly hedges of European fields;\r\n",
      "sago-bushes, large ferns with gorgeous branches, varied the aspect of\r\n",
      "this tropical clime; while nutmeg-trees in full foliage filled the air\r\n",
      "with a penetrating perfume.  Agile and grinning bands of monkeys\r\n",
      "skipped about in the trees, nor were tigers wanting in the jungles.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After a drive of two hours through the country, Aouda and Mr. Fogg\r\n",
      "returned to the town, which is a vast collection of heavy-looking,\r\n",
      "irregular houses, surrounded by charming gardens rich in tropical\r\n",
      "fruits and plants; and at ten o'clock they re-embarked, closely\r\n",
      "followed by the detective, who had kept them constantly in sight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout, who had been purchasing several dozen mangoes--a fruit\r\n",
      "as large as good-sized apples, of a dark-brown colour outside and a\r\n",
      "bright red within, and whose white pulp, melting in the mouth, affords\r\n",
      "gourmands a delicious sensation--was waiting for them on deck.  He was\r\n",
      "only too glad to offer some mangoes to Aouda, who thanked him very\r\n",
      "gracefully for them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At eleven o'clock the Rangoon rode out of Singapore harbour, and in a\r\n",
      "few hours the high mountains of Malacca, with their forests, inhabited\r\n",
      "by the most beautifully-furred tigers in the world, were lost to view.\r\n",
      "Singapore is distant some thirteen hundred miles from the island of\r\n",
      "Hong Kong, which is a little English colony near the Chinese coast.\r\n",
      "Phileas Fogg hoped to accomplish the journey in six days, so as to be\r\n",
      "in time for the steamer which would leave on the 6th of November for\r\n",
      "Yokohama, the principal Japanese port.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Rangoon had a large quota of passengers, many of whom disembarked\r\n",
      "at Singapore, among them a number of Indians, Ceylonese, Chinamen,\r\n",
      "Malays, and Portuguese, mostly second-class travellers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The weather, which had hitherto been fine, changed with the last\r\n",
      "quarter of the moon.  The sea rolled heavily, and the wind at intervals\r\n",
      "rose almost to a storm, but happily blew from the south-west, and thus\r\n",
      "aided the steamer's progress.  The captain as often as possible put up\r\n",
      "his sails, and under the double action of steam and sail the vessel\r\n",
      "made rapid progress along the coasts of Anam and Cochin China.  Owing\r\n",
      "to the defective construction of the Rangoon, however, unusual\r\n",
      "precautions became necessary in unfavourable weather; but the loss of\r\n",
      "time which resulted from this cause, while it nearly drove Passepartout\r\n",
      "out of his senses, did not seem to affect his master in the least.\r\n",
      "Passepartout blamed the captain, the engineer, and the crew, and\r\n",
      "consigned all who were connected with the ship to the land where the\r\n",
      "pepper grows.  Perhaps the thought of the gas, which was remorselessly\r\n",
      "burning at his expense in Saville Row, had something to do with his hot\r\n",
      "impatience.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\"You're a sly dog!\" said Passepartout, winking at him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This expression rather disturbed Fix, without his knowing why.  Had the\r\n",
      "Frenchman guessed his real purpose?  He knew not what to think.  But\r\n",
      "how could Passepartout have discovered that he was a detective?  Yet,\r\n",
      "in speaking as he did, the man evidently meant more than he expressed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Mr. Fix,\" said he, in a bantering tone, \"shall we be so unfortunate as\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Why,\" responded Fix, a little embarrassed, \"I don't know; perhaps--\"\r\n",

      "\"Ah, if you would only go on with us!  An agent of the Peninsular\r\n",
      "Company, you know, can't stop on the way!  You were only going to\r\n",
      "Bombay, and here you are in China.  America is not far off, and from\r\n",
      "America to Europe is only a step.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fix looked intently at his companion, whose countenance was as serene\r\n",
      "as possible, and laughed with him.  But Passepartout persisted in\r\n",
      "chaffing him by asking him if he made much by his present occupation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, and no,\" returned Fix; \"there is good and bad luck in such\r\n",
      "things.  But you must understand that I don't travel at my own expense.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, I am quite sure of that!\" cried Passepartout, laughing heartily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fix, fairly puzzled, descended to his cabin and gave himself up to his\r\n",
      "reflections.  He was evidently suspected; somehow or other the\r\n",
      "Frenchman had found out that he was a detective.  But had he told his\r\n",
      "master?  What part was he playing in all this: was he an accomplice or\r\n",
      "not?  Was the game, then, up?  Fix spent several hours turning these\r\n",
      "things over in his mind, sometimes thinking that all was lost, then\r\n",
      "persuading himself that Fogg was ignorant of his presence, and then\r\n",
      "undecided what course it was best to take.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "that last foothold of English territory, he, Fix, would tell\r\n",

      "obliged to await for a week the sailing of the next steamer.  Mr. Fogg\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The steamer which crossed the Pacific from Yokohama to San Francisco\r\n",
      "made a direct connection with that from Hong Kong, and it could not\r\n",
      "sail until the latter reached Yokohama; and if Mr. Fogg was twenty-four\r\n",
      "hours late on reaching Yokohama, this time would no doubt be easily\r\n",
      "regained in the voyage of twenty-two days across the Pacific.  He found\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "On landing, he conducted her to a palanquin, in which they repaired to\r\n",
      "the Club Hotel.  A room was engaged for the young woman, and Mr. Fogg,\r\n",
      "after seeing that she wanted for nothing, set out in search of her\r\n",

      "would know so wealthy and considerable a personage as the Parsee\r\n",
      "merchant.  Meeting a broker, he made the inquiry, to learn that Jeejeeh\r\n",
      "had left China two years before, and, retiring from business with an\r\n",
      "immense fortune, had taken up his residence in Europe--in Holland the\r\n",
      "broker thought, with the merchants of which country he had principally\r\n",
      "traded.  Phileas Fogg returned to the hotel, begged a moment's\r\n",
      "conversation with Aouda, and without more ado, apprised her that\r\n",
      "Jeejeeh was no longer at Hong Kong, but probably in Holland.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Aouda at first said nothing.  She passed her hand across her forehead,\r\n",
      "and reflected a few moments.  Then, in her sweet, soft voice, she said:\r\n",
      "\"What ought I to do, Mr. Fogg?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It is very simple,\" responded the gentleman.  \"Go on to Europe.\"\r\n",

      "unlike Bombay, Calcutta, and Singapore, since, like them, it betrayed\r\n",

      "beer, porter, gin, and brandy; smoking, the while, long red clay pipes\r\n",
      "stuffed with little balls of opium mingled with essence of rose.  From\r\n",

      "amount of one million four hundred thousand pounds--thousands devoted\r\n",
      "to one of the most despicable vices which afflict humanity!  The\r\n",

      "first exclusively reserved, to the lower classes, and then its ravages\r\n",
      "could not be arrested.  Opium is smoked everywhere, at all times, by\r\n",
      "men and women, in the Celestial Empire; and, once accustomed to it, the\r\n",
      "victims cannot dispense with it, except by suffering horrible bodily\r\n",
      "contortions and agonies.  A great smoker can smoke as many as eight\r\n",
      "pipes a day; but he dies in five years.  It was in one of these dens\r\n",

      "\"Of course I do,\" returned Passepartout.  \"Twenty thousand pounds.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Fix pushed Passepartout back in his chair, and resumed: \"Fifty-five\r\n",
      "thousand pounds; and if I succeed, I get two thousand pounds.  If\r\n",
      "you'll help me, I'll let you have five hundred of them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Help you?\" cried Passepartout, whose eyes were standing wide open.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes; help me keep Mr. Fogg here for two or three days.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, what are you saying?  Those gentlemen are not satisfied with\r\n",
      "following my master and suspecting his honour, but they must try to put\r\n",
      "obstacles in his way!  I blush for them!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do you mean?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I mean that it is a piece of shameful trickery.  They might as well\r\n",
      "waylay Mr. Fogg and put his money in their pockets!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's just what we count on doing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's a conspiracy, then,\" cried Passepartout, who became more and more\r\n",
      "excited as the liquor mounted in his head, for he drank without\r\n",
      "perceiving it.  \"A real conspiracy!  And gentlemen, too. Bah!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fix began to be puzzled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Members of the Reform Club!\" continued Passepartout.  \"You must know,\r\n",
      "Monsieur Fix, that my master is an honest man, and that, when he makes\r\n",
      "a wager, he tries to win it fairly!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But who do you think I am?\" asked Fix, looking at him intently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Parbleu!  An agent of the members of the Reform Club, sent out here to\r\n",
      "interrupt my master's journey.  But, though I found you out some time\r\n",
      "ago, I've taken good care to say nothing about it to Mr. Fogg.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He knows nothing, then?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nothing,\" replied Passepartout, again emptying his glass.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The detective passed his hand across his forehead, hesitating before he\r\n",
      "spoke again.  What should he do?  Passepartout's mistake seemed\r\n",
      "sincere, but it made his design more difficult.  It was evident that\r\n",
      "the servant was not the master's accomplice, as Fix had been inclined\r\n",
      "to suspect.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" said the detective to himself, \"as he is not an accomplice, he\r\n",
      "will help me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had no time to lose: Fogg must be detained at Hong Kong, so he\r\n",
      "resolved to make a clean breast of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Listen to me,\" said Fix abruptly.  \"I am not, as you think, an agent\r\n",
      "of the members of the Reform Club--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Bah!\" retorted Passepartout, with an air of raillery.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I am a police detective, sent out here by the London office.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You, a detective?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I will prove it.  Here is my commission.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout was speechless with astonishment when Fix displayed this\r\n",
      "document, the genuineness of which could not be doubted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mr. Fogg's wager,\" resumed Fix, \"is only a pretext, of which you and\r\n",
      "the gentlemen of the Reform are dupes.  He had a motive for securing\r\n",
      "your innocent complicity.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But why?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Listen.  On the 28th of last September a robbery of fifty-five\r\n",
      "thousand pounds was committed at the Bank of England by a person whose\r\n",
      "description was fortunately secured.  Here is his description; it\r\n",
      "answers exactly to that of Mr. Phileas Fogg.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What nonsense!\" cried Passepartout, striking the table with his fist.\r\n",
      "\"My master is the most honourable of men!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How can you tell?  You know scarcely anything about him.  You went\r\n",
      "into his service the day he came away; and he came away on a foolish\r\n",
      "pretext, without trunks, and carrying a large amount in banknotes.  And\r\n",
      "yet you are bold enough to assert that he is an honest man!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, yes,\" repeated the poor fellow, mechanically.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Would you like to be arrested as his accomplice?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout, overcome by what he had heard, held his head between his\r\n",
      "hands, and did not dare to look at the detective.  Phileas Fogg, the\r\n",
      "saviour of Aouda, that brave and generous man, a robber!  And yet how\r\n",
      "many presumptions there were against him!  Passepartout essayed to\r\n",
      "reject the suspicions which forced themselves upon his mind; he did not\r\n",
      "wish to believe that his master was guilty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, what do you want of me?\" said he, at last, with an effort.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"See here,\" replied Fix; \"I have tracked Mr. Fogg to this place, but as\r\n",
      "yet I have failed to receive the warrant of arrest for which I sent to\r\n",
      "London.  You must help me to keep him here in Hong Kong--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I!  But I--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I will share with you the two thousand pounds reward offered by the\r\n",
      "Bank of England.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Never!\" replied Passepartout, who tried to rise, but fell back,\r\n",
      "exhausted in mind and body.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mr. Fix,\" he stammered, \"even should what you say be true--if my\r\n",
      "master is really the robber you are seeking for--which I deny--I have\r\n",
      "been, am, in his service; I have seen his generosity and goodness; and\r\n",
      "I will never betray him--not for all the gold in the world.  I come\r\n",
      "from a village where they don't eat that kind of bread!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You refuse?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I refuse.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Consider that I've said nothing,\" said Fix; \"and let us drink.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes; let us drink!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout felt himself yielding more and more to the effects of the\r\n",
      "liquor.  Fix, seeing that he must, at all hazards, be separated from\r\n",
      "his master, wished to entirely overcome him.  Some pipes full of opium\r\n",
      "lay upon the table.  Fix slipped one into Passepartout's hand.  He took\r\n",
      "it, put it between his lips, lit it, drew several puffs, and his head,\r\n",
      "becoming heavy under the influence of the narcotic, fell upon the table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"At last!\" said Fix, seeing Passepartout unconscious.  \"Mr. Fogg will\r\n",
      "not be informed of the Carnatic's departure; and, if he is, he will\r\n",
      "have to go without this cursed Frenchman!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And, after paying his bill, Fix left the tavern.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "IN WHICH FIX COMES FACE TO FACE WITH PHILEAS FOGG\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While these events were passing at the opium-house, Mr. Fogg,\r\n",
      "unconscious of the danger he was in of losing the steamer, was quietly\r\n",
      "escorting Aouda about the streets of the English quarter, making the\r\n",
      "necessary purchases for the long voyage before them.  It was all very\r\n",
      "well for an Englishman like Mr. Fogg to make the tour of the world with\r\n",
      "a carpet-bag; a lady could not be expected to travel comfortably under\r\n",
      "such conditions.  He acquitted his task with characteristic serenity,\r\n",
      "and invariably replied to the remonstrances of his fair companion, who\r\n",
      "was confused by his patience and generosity:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It is in the interest of my journey--a part of my programme.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The purchases made, they returned to the hotel, where they dined at a\r\n",
      "sumptuously served table-d'hote; after which Aouda, shaking hands with\r\n",
      "her protector after the English fashion, retired to her room for rest.\r\n",
      "Mr. Fogg absorbed himself throughout the evening in the perusal of The\r\n",
      "Times and Illustrated London News.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Had he been capable of being astonished at anything, it would have been\r\n",
      "not to see his servant return at bedtime.  But, knowing that the\r\n",
      "steamer was not to leave for Yokohama until the next morning, he did\r\n",
      "not disturb himself about the matter.  When Passepartout did not appear\r\n",
      "the next morning to answer his master's bell, Mr. Fogg, not betraying\r\n",
      "the least vexation, contented himself with taking his carpet-bag,\r\n",
      "calling Aouda, and sending for a palanquin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was then eight o'clock; at half-past nine, it being then high tide,\r\n",
      "the Carnatic would leave the harbour.  Mr. Fogg and Aouda got into the\r\n",
      "palanquin, their luggage being brought after on a wheelbarrow, and half\r\n",
      "an hour later stepped upon the quay whence they were to embark.  Mr.\r\n",
      "Fogg then learned that the Carnatic had sailed the evening before.  He\r\n",
      "had expected to find not only the steamer, but his domestic, and was\r\n",
      "forced to give up both; but no sign of disappointment appeared on his\r\n",
      "face, and he merely remarked to Aouda, \"It is an accident, madam;\r\n",
      "nothing more.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this moment a man who had been observing him attentively approached.\r\n",
      "It was Fix, who, bowing, addressed Mr. Fogg:  \"Were you not, like me,\r\n",
      "sir, a passenger by the Rangoon, which arrived yesterday?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I was, sir,\" replied Mr. Fogg coldly.  \"But I have not the honour--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Pardon me; I thought I should find your servant here.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you know where he is, sir?\" asked Aouda anxiously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What!\" responded Fix, feigning surprise.  \"Is he not with you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No,\" said Aouda.  \"He has not made his appearance since yesterday.\r\n",
      "Could he have gone on board the Carnatic without us?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Without you, madam?\" answered the detective.  \"Excuse me, did you\r\n",
      "intend to sail in the Carnatic?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So did I, madam, and I am excessively disappointed.  The Carnatic, its\r\n",
      "repairs being completed, left Hong Kong twelve hours before the stated\r\n",
      "time, without any notice being given; and we must now wait a week for\r\n",
      "another steamer.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he said \"a week\" Fix felt his heart leap for joy.  Fogg detained at\r\n",
      "Hong Kong for a week!  There would be time for the warrant to arrive,\r\n",
      "and fortune at last favoured the representative of the law.  His horror\r\n",
      "may be imagined when he heard Mr. Fogg say, in his placid voice, \"But\r\n",
      "there are other vessels besides the Carnatic, it seems to me, in the\r\n",
      "harbour of Hong Kong.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And, offering his arm to Aouda, he directed his steps toward the docks\r\n",
      "in search of some craft about to start.  Fix, stupefied, followed; it\r\n",
      "seemed as if he were attached to Mr. Fogg by an invisible thread.\r\n",
      "Chance, however, appeared really to have abandoned the man it had\r\n",
      "hitherto served so well.  For three hours Phileas Fogg wandered about\r\n",
      "the docks, with the determination, if necessary, to charter a vessel to\r\n",
      "carry him to Yokohama; but he could only find vessels which were\r\n",
      "loading or unloading, and which could not therefore set sail.  Fix\r\n",
      "began to hope again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Mr. Fogg, far from being discouraged, was continuing his search,\r\n",
      "resolved not to stop if he had to resort to Macao, when he was accosted\r\n",
      "by a sailor on one of the wharves.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is your honour looking for a boat?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Have you a boat ready to sail?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, your honour; a pilot-boat--No. 43--the best in the harbour.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Does she go fast?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Between eight and nine knots the hour.  Will you look at her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Your honour will be satisfied with her.  Is it for a sea excursion?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No; for a voyage.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A voyage?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, will you agree to take me to Yokohama?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sailor leaned on the railing, opened his eyes wide, and said, \"Is\r\n",
      "your honour joking?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No.  I have missed the Carnatic, and I must get to Yokohama by the\r\n",
      "14th at the latest, to take the boat for San Francisco.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I am sorry,\" said the sailor; \"but it is impossible.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I offer you a hundred pounds per day, and an additional reward of two\r\n",
      "hundred pounds if I reach Yokohama in time.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Are you in earnest?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very much so.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The pilot walked away a little distance, and gazed out to sea,\r\n",
      "evidently struggling between the anxiety to gain a large sum and the\r\n",
      "fear of venturing so far.  Fix was in mortal suspense.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Fogg turned to Aouda and asked her, \"You would not be afraid, would\r\n",
      "you, madam?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not with you, Mr. Fogg,\" was her answer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The pilot now returned, shuffling his hat in his hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, pilot?\" said Mr. Fogg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, your honour,\" replied he, \"I could not risk myself, my men, or\r\n",
      "my little boat of scarcely twenty tons on so long a voyage at this time\r\n",
      "of year.  Besides, we could not reach Yokohama in time, for it is\r\n",
      "sixteen hundred and sixty miles from Hong Kong.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Only sixteen hundred,\" said Mr. Fogg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's the same thing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fix breathed more freely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But,\" added the pilot, \"it might be arranged another way.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fix ceased to breathe at all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How?\" asked Mr. Fogg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"By going to Nagasaki, at the extreme south of Japan, or even to\r\n",
      "Shanghai, which is only eight hundred miles from here.  In going to\r\n",
      "Shanghai we should not be forced to sail wide of the Chinese coast,\r\n",
      "which would be a great advantage, as the currents run northward, and\r\n",
      "would aid us.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Pilot,\" said Mr. Fogg, \"I must take the American steamer at Yokohama,\r\n",
      "and not at Shanghai or Nagasaki.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why not?\" returned the pilot.  \"The San Francisco steamer does not\r\n",
      "start from Yokohama.  It puts in at Yokohama and Nagasaki, but it\r\n",
      "starts from Shanghai.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You are sure of that?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Perfectly.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And when does the boat leave Shanghai?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"On the 11th, at seven in the evening.  We have, therefore, four days\r\n",
      "before us, that is ninety-six hours; and in that time, if we had good\r\n",
      "luck and a south-west wind, and the sea was calm, we could make those\r\n",
      "eight hundred miles to Shanghai.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And you could go--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In an hour; as soon as provisions could be got aboard and the sails\r\n",
      "put up.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It is a bargain.  Are you the master of the boat?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes; John Bunsby, master of the Tankadere.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Would you like some earnest-money?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If it would not put your honour out--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Here are two hundred pounds on account sir,\" added Phileas Fogg,\r\n",
      "turning to Fix, \"if you would like to take advantage--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thanks, sir; I was about to ask the favour.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very well.  In half an hour we shall go on board.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But poor Passepartout?\" urged Aouda, who was much disturbed by the\r\n",
      "servant's disappearance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I shall do all I can to find him,\" replied Phileas Fogg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While Fix, in a feverish, nervous state, repaired to the pilot-boat,\r\n",
      "the others directed their course to the police-station at Hong Kong.\r\n",
      "Phileas Fogg there gave Passepartout's description, and left a sum of\r\n",
      "money to be spent in the search for him.  The same formalities having\r\n",
      "been gone through at the French consulate, and the palanquin having\r\n",
      "stopped at the hotel for the luggage, which had been sent back there,\r\n",
      "they returned to the wharf.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was now three o'clock; and pilot-boat No. 43, with its crew on\r\n",
      "board, and its provisions stored away, was ready for departure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Tankadere was a neat little craft of twenty tons, as gracefully\r\n",
      "built as if she were a racing yacht.  Her shining copper sheathing, her\r\n",
      "galvanised iron-work, her deck, white as ivory, betrayed the pride\r\n",
      "taken by John Bunsby in making her presentable.  Her two masts leaned a\r\n",
      "trifle backward; she carried brigantine, foresail, storm-jib, and\r\n",
      "standing-jib, and was well rigged for running before the wind; and she\r\n",
      "seemed capable of brisk speed, which, indeed, she had already proved by\r\n",
      "gaining several prizes in pilot-boat races.  The crew of the Tankadere\r\n",
      "was composed of John Bunsby, the master, and four hardy mariners, who\r\n",
      "were familiar with the Chinese seas.  John Bunsby, himself, a man of\r\n",
      "forty-five or thereabouts, vigorous, sunburnt, with a sprightly\r\n",
      "expression of the eye, and energetic and self-reliant countenance,\r\n",
      "would have inspired confidence in the most timid.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Phileas Fogg and Aouda went on board, where they found Fix already\r\n",
      "installed.  Below deck was a square cabin, of which the walls bulged\r\n",
      "out in the form of cots, above a circular divan; in the centre was a\r\n",
      "table provided with a swinging lamp.  The accommodation was confined,\r\n",

      "Fix, seated in the bow, gave himself up to meditation.  He kept apart\r\n",
      "from his fellow-travellers, knowing Mr. Fogg's taciturn tastes;\r\n",
      "besides, he did not quite like to talk to the man whose favours he had\r\n",
      "accepted.  He was thinking, too, of the future.  It seemed certain that\r\n",
      "Fogg would not stop at Yokohama, but would at once take the boat for\r\n",
      "San Francisco; and the vast extent of America would ensure him impunity\r\n",
      "and safety.  Fogg's plan appeared to him the simplest in the world.\r\n",
      "Instead of sailing directly from England to the United States, like a\r\n",
      "common villain, he had traversed three quarters of the globe, so as to\r\n",
      "gain the American continent more surely; and there, after throwing the\r\n",
      "police off his track, he would quietly enjoy himself with the fortune\r\n",
      "stolen from the bank.  But, once in the United States, what should he,\r\n",
      "Fix, do?  Should he abandon this man?  No, a hundred times no!  Until\r\n",
      "he had secured his extradition, he would not lose sight of him for an\r\n",
      "hour.  It was his duty, and he would fulfil it to the end.  At all\r\n",
      "events, there was one thing to be thankful for; Passepartout was not\r\n",
      "with his master; and it was above all important, after the confidences\r\n",
      "Fix had imparted to him, that the servant should never have speech with\r\n",
      "his master.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Phileas Fogg was also thinking of Passepartout, who had so strangely\r\n",
      "disappeared.  Looking at the matter from every point of view, it did\r\n",
      "not seem to him impossible that, by some mistake, the man might have\r\n",
      "embarked on the Carnatic at the last moment; and this was also Aouda's\r\n",
      "opinion, who regretted very much the loss of the worthy fellow to whom\r\n",
      "she owed so much.  They might then find him at Yokohama; for, if the\r\n",
      "Carnatic was carrying him thither, it would be easy to ascertain if he\r\n",
      "had been on board.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A brisk breeze arose about ten o'clock; but, though it might have been\r\n",
      "prudent to take in a reef, the pilot, after carefully examining the\r\n",
      "heavens, let the craft remain rigged as before.  The Tankadere bore\r\n",
      "sail admirably, as she drew a great deal of water, and everything was\r\n",
      "prepared for high speed in case of a gale.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Fogg and Aouda descended into the cabin at midnight, having been\r\n",
      "already preceded by Fix, who had lain down on one of the cots.  The\r\n",
      "pilot and crew remained on deck all night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At sunrise the next day, which was 8th November, the boat had made more\r\n",
      "than one hundred miles.  The log indicated a mean speed of between\r\n",
      "eight and nine miles.  The Tankadere still carried all sail, and was\r\n",
      "accomplishing her greatest capacity of speed.  If the wind held as it\r\n",
      "was, the chances would be in her favour.  During the day she kept along\r\n",
      "the coast, where the currents were favourable; the coast, irregular in\r\n",
      "profile, and visible sometimes across the clearings, was at most five\r\n",
      "miles distant.  The sea was less boisterous, since the wind came off\r\n",
      "land--a fortunate circumstance for the boat, which would suffer, owing\r\n",
      "to its small tonnage, by a heavy surge on the sea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The breeze subsided a little towards noon, and set in from the\r\n",
      "south-west.  The pilot put up his poles, but took them down again\r\n",
      "within two hours, as the wind freshened up anew.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Fogg and Aouda, happily unaffected by the roughness of the sea, ate\r\n",
      "with a good appetite, Fix being invited to share their repast, which he\r\n",
      "accepted with secret chagrin.  To travel at this man's expense and live\r\n",
      "upon his provisions was not palatable to him.  Still, he was obliged to\r\n",
      "eat, and so he ate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the meal was over, he took Mr. Fogg apart, and said, \"sir\"--this\r\n",
      "\"sir\" scorched his lips, and he had to control himself to avoid\r\n",
      "collaring this \"gentleman\"--\"sir, you have been very kind to give me a\r\n",
      "passage on this boat.  But, though my means will not admit of my\r\n",
      "expending them as freely as you, I must ask to pay my share--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let us not speak of that, sir,\" replied Mr. Fogg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But, if I insist--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, sir,\" repeated Mr. Fogg, in a tone which did not admit of a reply.\r\n",
      "\"This enters into my general expenses.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fix, as he bowed, had a stifled feeling, and, going forward, where he\r\n",
      "ensconced himself, did not open his mouth for the rest of the day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile they were progressing famously, and John Bunsby was in high\r\n",
      "hope.  He several times assured Mr. Fogg that they would reach Shanghai\r\n",
      "in time; to which that gentleman responded that he counted upon it.\r\n",
      "The crew set to work in good earnest, inspired by the reward to be\r\n",
      "gained.  There was not a sheet which was not tightened, not a sail which\r\n",
      "was not vigorously hoisted; not a lurch could be charged to the man at\r\n",
      "the helm.  They worked as desperately as if they were contesting in a\r\n",
      "Royal yacht regatta.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By evening, the log showed that two hundred and twenty miles had been\r\n",
      "accomplished from Hong Kong, and Mr. Fogg might hope that he would be\r\n",
      "able to reach Yokohama without recording any delay in his journal; in\r\n",
      "which case, the many misadventures which had overtaken him since he\r\n",
      "left London would not seriously affect his journey.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Tankadere entered the Straits of Fo-Kien, which separate the island\r\n",
      "of Formosa from the Chinese coast, in the small hours of the night, and\r\n",
      "crossed the Tropic of Cancer.  The sea was very rough in the straits,\r\n",
      "full of eddies formed by the counter-currents, and the chopping waves\r\n",
      "broke her course, whilst it became very difficult to stand on deck.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At daybreak the wind began to blow hard again, and the heavens seemed\r\n",
      "to predict a gale.  The barometer announced a speedy change, the\r\n",
      "mercury rising and falling capriciously; the sea also, in the\r\n",
      "south-east, raised long surges which indicated a tempest.  The sun had\r\n",
      "set the evening before in a red mist, in the midst of the\r\n",
      "phosphorescent scintillations of the ocean.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "John Bunsby long examined the threatening aspect of the heavens,\r\n",
      "muttering indistinctly between his teeth.  At last he said in a low\r\n",
      "voice to Mr. Fogg, \"Shall I speak out to your honour?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, we are going to have a squall.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is the wind north or south?\" asked Mr. Fogg quietly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"South.  Look! a typhoon is coming up.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Glad it's a typhoon from the south, for it will carry us forward.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, if you take it that way,\" said John Bunsby, \"I've nothing more to\r\n",
      "say.\" John Bunsby's suspicions were confirmed.  At a less advanced\r\n",
      "season of the year the typhoon, according to a famous meteorologist,\r\n",
      "would have passed away like a luminous cascade of electric flame; but\r\n",
      "in the winter equinox it was to be feared that it would burst upon them\r\n",
      "with great violence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The pilot took his precautions in advance.  He reefed all sail, the\r\n",
      "pole-masts were dispensed with; all hands went forward to the bows.  A\r\n",
      "single triangular sail, of strong canvas, was hoisted as a storm-jib,\r\n",
      "so as to hold the wind from behind.  Then they waited.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "John Bunsby had requested his passengers to go below; but this\r\n",
      "imprisonment in so narrow a space, with little air, and the boat\r\n",
      "bouncing in the gale, was far from pleasant.  Neither Mr. Fogg, Fix,\r\n",
      "nor Aouda consented to leave the deck.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The storm of rain and wind descended upon them towards eight o'clock.\r\n",
      "With but its bit of sail, the Tankadere was lifted like a feather by a\r\n",
      "wind, an idea of whose violence can scarcely be given.  To compare her\r\n",
      "speed to four times that of a locomotive going on full steam would be\r\n",
      "below the truth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The boat scudded thus northward during the whole day, borne on by\r\n",
      "monstrous waves, preserving always, fortunately, a speed equal to\r\n",
      "theirs.  Twenty times she seemed almost to be submerged by these\r\n",
      "mountains of water which rose behind her; but the adroit management of\r\n",
      "the pilot saved her.  The passengers were often bathed in spray, but\r\n",
      "they submitted to it philosophically.  Fix cursed it, no doubt; but\r\n",
      "Aouda, with her eyes fastened upon her protector, whose coolness amazed\r\n",
      "her, showed herself worthy of him, and bravely weathered the storm.  As\r\n",
      "for Phileas Fogg, it seemed just as if the typhoon were a part of his\r\n",
      "programme.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Up to this time the Tankadere had always held her course to the north;\r\n",
      "but towards evening the wind, veering three quarters, bore down from\r\n",
      "the north-west.  The boat, now lying in the trough of the waves, shook\r\n",
      "and rolled terribly; the sea struck her with fearful violence.  At\r\n",
      "night the tempest increased in violence.  John Bunsby saw the approach\r\n",
      "of darkness and the rising of the storm with dark misgivings.  He\r\n",
      "thought awhile, and then asked his crew if it was not time to slacken\r\n",
      "speed.  After a consultation he approached Mr. Fogg, and said, \"I\r\n",
      "think, your honour, that we should do well to make for one of the ports\r\n",
      "on the coast.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I think so too.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah!\" said the pilot.  \"But which one?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I know of but one,\" returned Mr. Fogg tranquilly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And that is--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Shanghai.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The pilot, at first, did not seem to comprehend; he could scarcely\r\n",
      "realise so much determination and tenacity.  Then he cried, \"Well--yes!\r\n",
      "Your honour is right.  To Shanghai!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So the Tankadere kept steadily on her northward track.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The night was really terrible; it would be a miracle if the craft did\r\n",
      "not founder.  Twice it could have been all over with her if the crew\r\n",
      "had not been constantly on the watch.  Aouda was exhausted, but did not\r\n",
      "utter a complaint.  More than once Mr. Fogg rushed to protect her from\r\n",
      "the violence of the waves.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Day reappeared.  The tempest still raged with undiminished fury; but\r\n",
      "the wind now returned to the south-east.  It was a favourable change,\r\n",
      "and the Tankadere again bounded forward on this mountainous sea, though\r\n",
      "the waves crossed each other, and imparted shocks and counter-shocks\r\n",
      "which would have crushed a craft less solidly built.  From time to time\r\n",
      "the coast was visible through the broken mist, but no vessel was in\r\n",
      "sight.  The Tankadere was alone upon the sea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were some signs of a calm at noon, and these became more distinct\r\n",
      "as the sun descended toward the horizon.  The tempest had been as brief\r\n",
      "as terrific.  The passengers, thoroughly exhausted, could now eat a\r\n",
      "little, and take some repose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The night was comparatively quiet.  Some of the sails were again\r\n",
      "hoisted, and the speed of the boat was very good.  The next morning at\r\n",
      "dawn they espied the coast, and John Bunsby was able to assert that\r\n",
      "they were not one hundred miles from Shanghai.  A hundred miles, and\r\n",
      "only one day to traverse them!  That very evening Mr. Fogg was due at\r\n",
      "Shanghai, if he did not wish to miss the steamer to Yokohama.  Had\r\n",
      "there been no storm, during which several hours were lost, they would\r\n",
      "be at this moment within thirty miles of their destination.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The wind grew decidedly calmer, and happily the sea fell with it.  All\r\n",
      "sails were now hoisted, and at noon the Tankadere was within forty-five\r\n",
      "miles of Shanghai.  There remained yet six hours in which to accomplish\r\n",
      "that distance.  All on board feared that it could not be done, and\r\n",
      "every one--Phileas Fogg, no doubt, excepted--felt his heart beat with\r\n",
      "impatience.  The boat must keep up an average of nine miles an hour,\r\n",
      "and the wind was becoming calmer every moment!  It was a capricious\r\n",
      "breeze, coming from the coast, and after it passed the sea became\r\n",
      "smooth.  Still, the Tankadere was so light, and her fine sails caught\r\n",
      "the fickle zephyrs so well, that, with the aid of the currents John\r\n",
      "Bunsby found himself at six o'clock not more than ten miles from the\r\n",
      "mouth of Shanghai River.  Shanghai itself is situated at least twelve\r\n",
      "miles up the stream.  At seven they were still three miles from\r\n",
      "Shanghai.  The pilot swore an angry oath; the reward of two hundred\r\n",
      "pounds was evidently on the point of escaping him.  He looked at Mr.\r\n",
      "Fogg.  Mr. Fogg was perfectly tranquil; and yet his whole fortune was\r\n",
      "at this moment at stake.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this moment, also, a long black funnel, crowned with wreaths of\r\n",
      "smoke, appeared on the edge of the waters.  It was the American\r\n",
      "steamer, leaving for Yokohama at the appointed time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Confound her!\" cried John Bunsby, pushing back the rudder with a\r\n",
      "desperate jerk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Signal her!\" said Phileas Fogg quietly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A small brass cannon stood on the forward deck of the Tankadere, for\r\n",
      "making signals in the fogs.  It was loaded to the muzzle; but just as\r\n",
      "the pilot was about to apply a red-hot coal to the touchhole, Mr. Fogg\r\n",
      "said, \"Hoist your flag!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The flag was run up at half-mast, and, this being the signal of\r\n",
      "distress, it was hoped that the American steamer, perceiving it, would\r\n",
      "change her course a little, so as to succour the pilot-boat.\r\n",

      "unconscious Passepartout, and had carried him to the bed reserved for\r\n",
      "the smokers.  Three hours later, pursued even in his dreams by a fixed\r\n",
      "idea, the poor fellow awoke, and struggled against the stupefying\r\n",
      "influence of the narcotic.  The thought of a duty unfulfilled shook off\r\n",
      "his torpor, and he hurried from the abode of drunkenness.  Staggering\r\n",
      "and holding himself up by keeping against the walls, falling down and\r\n",
      "creeping up again, and irresistibly impelled by a kind of instinct, he\r\n",
      "kept crying out, \"The Carnatic! the Carnatic!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The steamer lay puffing alongside the quay, on the point of starting.\r\n",
      "Passepartout had but few steps to go; and, rushing upon the plank, he\r\n",
      "crossed it, and fell unconscious on the deck, just as the Carnatic was\r\n",
      "moving off.  Several sailors, who were evidently accustomed to this\r\n",
      "sort of scene, carried the poor Frenchman down into the second cabin,\r\n",
      "and Passepartout did not wake until they were one hundred and fifty\r\n",
      "miles away from China.  Thus he found himself the next morning on the\r\n",
      "deck of the Carnatic, and eagerly inhaling the exhilarating sea-breeze.\r\n",
      "The pure air sobered him.  He began to collect his sense, which he\r\n",
      "found a difficult task; but at last he recalled the events of the\r\n",
      "evening before, Fix's revelation, and the opium-house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It is evident,\" said he to himself, \"that I have been abominably\r\n",
      "drunk!  What will Mr. Fogg say?  At least I have not missed the\r\n",
      "steamer, which is the most important thing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then, as Fix occurred to him: \"As for that rascal, I hope we are well\r\n",
      "rid of him, and that he has not dared, as he proposed, to follow us on\r\n",
      "board the Carnatic.  A detective on the track of Mr. Fogg, accused of\r\n",
      "robbing the Bank of England!  Pshaw!  Mr. Fogg is no more a robber than\r\n",
      "I am a murderer.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Should he divulge Fix's real errand to his master?  Would it do to tell\r\n",
      "the part the detective was playing?  Would it not be better to wait\r\n",
      "until Mr. Fogg reached London again, and then impart to him that an\r\n",
      "agent of the metropolitan police had been following him round the\r\n",
      "world, and have a good laugh over it?  No doubt; at least, it was worth\r\n",
      "considering.  The first thing to do was to find Mr. Fogg, and apologise\r\n",
      "for his singular behaviour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout got up and proceeded, as well as he could with the rolling\r\n",
      "of the steamer, to the after-deck.  He saw no one who resembled either\r\n",
      "his master or Aouda.  \"Good!\"  muttered he; \"Aouda has not got up yet,\r\n",
      "and Mr. Fogg has probably found some partners at whist.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He descended to the saloon.  Mr. Fogg was not there.  Passepartout had\r\n",
      "only, however, to ask the purser the number of his master's state-room.\r\n",
      "The purser replied that he did not know any passenger by the name of\r\n",
      "Fogg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I beg your pardon,\" said Passepartout persistently.  \"He is a tall\r\n",
      "gentleman, quiet, and not very talkative, and has with him a young\r\n",
      "lady--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There is no young lady on board,\" interrupted the purser.  \"Here is a\r\n",
      "list of the passengers; you may see for yourself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout scanned the list, but his master's name was not upon it.\r\n",
      "All at once an idea struck him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah! am I on the Carnatic?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"On the way to Yokohama?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Certainly.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout had for an instant feared that he was on the wrong boat;\r\n",
      "but, though he was really on the Carnatic, his master was not there.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He fell thunderstruck on a seat.  He saw it all now.  He remembered\r\n",
      "that the time of sailing had been changed, that he should have informed\r\n",
      "his master of that fact, and that he had not done so.  It was his\r\n",
      "fault, then, that Mr. Fogg and Aouda had missed the steamer.  Yes, but\r\n",
      "it was still more the fault of the traitor who, in order to separate\r\n",
      "him from his master, and detain the latter at Hong Kong, had inveigled\r\n",
      "him into getting drunk!  He now saw the detective's trick; and at this\r\n",
      "moment Mr. Fogg was certainly ruined, his bet was lost, and he himself\r\n",
      "perhaps arrested and imprisoned!  At this thought Passepartout tore his\r\n",
      "hair.  Ah, if Fix ever came within his reach, what a settling of\r\n",
      "accounts there would be!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After his first depression, Passepartout became calmer, and began to\r\n",
      "study his situation.  It was certainly not an enviable one.  He found\r\n",
      "himself on the way to Japan, and what should he do when he got there?\r\n",
      "His pocket was empty; he had not a solitary shilling, not so much as a\r\n",
      "penny.  His passage had fortunately been paid for in advance; and he\r\n",
      "had five or six days in which to decide upon his future course.  He\r\n",
      "fell to at meals with an appetite, and ate for Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and\r\n",
      "himself.  He helped himself as generously as if Japan were a desert,\r\n",
      "where nothing to eat was to be looked for.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At dawn on the 13th the Carnatic entered the port of Yokohama.  This is\r\n",
      "an important port of call in the Pacific, where all the mail-steamers,\r\n",
      "and those carrying travellers between North America, China, Japan, and\r\n",
      "the Oriental islands put in.  It is situated in the bay of Yeddo, and\r\n",
      "at but a short distance from that second capital of the Japanese\r\n",
      "Empire, and the residence of the Tycoon, the civil Emperor, before the\r\n",
      "Mikado, the spiritual Emperor, absorbed his office in his own.  The\r\n",
      "Carnatic anchored at the quay near the custom-house, in the midst of a\r\n",
      "crowd of ships bearing the flags of all nations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout went timidly ashore on this so curious territory of the\r\n",
      "Sons of the Sun.  He had nothing better to do than, taking chance for\r\n",
      "his guide, to wander aimlessly through the streets of Yokohama.  He\r\n",
      "found himself at first in a thoroughly European quarter, the houses\r\n",
      "having low fronts, and being adorned with verandas, beneath which he\r\n",
      "caught glimpses of neat peristyles.  This quarter occupied, with its\r\n",
      "streets, squares, docks, and warehouses, all the space between the\r\n",
      "\"promontory of the Treaty\" and the river.  Here, as at Hong Kong and\r\n",
      "Calcutta, were mixed crowds of all races, Americans and English,\r\n",
      "Chinamen and Dutchmen, mostly merchants ready to buy or sell anything.\r\n",
      "The Frenchman felt himself as much alone among them as if he had\r\n",
      "dropped down in the midst of Hottentots.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had, at least, one resource,--to call on the French and English\r\n",
      "consuls at Yokohama for assistance.  But he shrank from telling the\r\n",
      "story of his adventures, intimately connected as it was with that of\r\n",
      "his master; and, before doing so, he determined to exhaust all other\r\n",
      "means of aid.  As chance did not favour him in the European quarter, he\r\n",
      "penetrated that inhabited by the native Japanese, determined, if\r\n",
      "necessary, to push on to Yeddo.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Japanese quarter of Yokohama is called Benten, after the goddess of\r\n",
      "the sea, who is worshipped on the islands round about.  There\r\n",
      "Passepartout beheld beautiful fir and cedar groves, sacred gates of a\r\n",
      "singular architecture, bridges half hid in the midst of bamboos and\r\n",
      "reeds, temples shaded by immense cedar-trees, holy retreats where were\r\n",
      "sheltered Buddhist priests and sectaries of Confucius, and interminable\r\n",
      "streets, where a perfect harvest of rose-tinted and red-cheeked\r\n",
      "children, who looked as if they had been cut out of Japanese screens,\r\n",
      "and who were playing in the midst of short-legged poodles and yellowish\r\n",
      "cats, might have been gathered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The streets were crowded with people.  Priests were passing in\r\n",
      "processions, beating their dreary tambourines; police and custom-house\r\n",
      "officers with pointed hats encrusted with lac and carrying two sabres\r\n",
      "hung to their waists; soldiers, clad in blue cotton with white stripes,\r\n",
      "and bearing guns; the Mikado's guards, enveloped in silken doubles,\r\n",
      "hauberks and coats of mail; and numbers of military folk of all\r\n",
      "ranks--for the military profession is as much respected in Japan as it\r\n",
      "is despised in China--went hither and thither in groups and pairs.\r\n",
      "Passepartout saw, too, begging friars, long-robed pilgrims, and simple\r\n",
      "civilians, with their warped and jet-black hair, big heads, long busts,\r\n",
      "slender legs, short stature, and complexions varying from copper-colour\r\n",
      "to a dead white, but never yellow, like the Chinese, from whom the\r\n",
      "Japanese widely differ.  He did not fail to observe the curious\r\n",
      "equipages--carriages and palanquins, barrows supplied with sails, and\r\n",
      "litters made of bamboo; nor the women--whom he thought not especially\r\n",
      "handsome--who took little steps with their little feet, whereon they\r\n",
      "wore canvas shoes, straw sandals, and clogs of worked wood, and who\r\n",
      "displayed tight-looking eyes, flat chests, teeth fashionably blackened,\r\n",
      "and gowns crossed with silken scarfs, tied in an enormous knot behind\r\n",
      "an ornament which the modern Parisian ladies seem to have borrowed from\r\n",
      "the dames of Japan.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout wandered for several hours in the midst of this motley\r\n",
      "crowd, looking in at the windows of the rich and curious shops, the\r\n",
      "jewellery establishments glittering with quaint Japanese ornaments, the\r\n",
      "restaurants decked with streamers and banners, the tea-houses, where\r\n",
      "the odorous beverage was being drunk with saki, a liquor concocted from\r\n",
      "the fermentation of rice, and the comfortable smoking-houses, where\r\n",
      "they were puffing, not opium, which is almost unknown in Japan, but a\r\n",
      "very fine, stringy tobacco.  He went on till he found himself in the\r\n",
      "fields, in the midst of vast rice plantations.  There he saw dazzling\r\n",
      "camellias expanding themselves, with flowers which were giving forth\r\n",
      "their last colours and perfumes, not on bushes, but on trees, and\r\n",
      "within bamboo enclosures, cherry, plum, and apple trees, which the\r\n",
      "Japanese cultivate rather for their blossoms than their fruit, and\r\n",
      "which queerly-fashioned, grinning scarecrows protected from the\r\n",
      "sparrows, pigeons, ravens, and other voracious birds.  On the branches\r\n",
      "of the cedars were perched large eagles; amid the foliage of the\r\n",
      "weeping willows were herons, solemnly standing on one leg; and on every\r\n",
      "hand were crows, ducks, hawks, wild birds, and a multitude of cranes,\r\n",
      "which the Japanese consider sacred, and which to their minds symbolise\r\n",
      "long life and prosperity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he was strolling along, Passepartout espied some violets among the\r\n",
      "shrubs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good!\" said he; \"I'll have some supper.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But, on smelling them, he found that they were odourless.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No chance there,\" thought he.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The worthy fellow had certainly taken good care to eat as hearty a\r\n",
      "breakfast as possible before leaving the Carnatic; but, as he had been\r\n",
      "walking about all day, the demands of hunger were becoming importunate.\r\n",
      "He observed that the butchers stalls contained neither mutton, goat,\r\n",
      "nor pork; and, knowing also that it is a sacrilege to kill cattle,\r\n",
      "which are preserved solely for farming, he made up his mind that meat\r\n",
      "was far from plentiful in Yokohama--nor was he mistaken; and, in\r\n",
      "default of butcher's meat, he could have wished for a quarter of wild\r\n",
      "boar or deer, a partridge, or some quails, some game or fish, which,\r\n",
      "with rice, the Japanese eat almost exclusively.  But he found it\r\n",
      "necessary to keep up a stout heart, and to postpone the meal he craved\r\n",
      "till the following morning.  Night came, and Passepartout re-entered\r\n",
      "the native quarter, where he wandered through the streets, lit by\r\n",
      "vari-coloured lanterns, looking on at the dancers, who were executing\r\n",
      "skilful steps and boundings, and the astrologers who stood in the open\r\n",
      "air with their telescopes.  Then he came to the harbour, which was lit\r\n",
      "up by the resin torches of the fishermen, who were fishing from their\r\n",
      "boats.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The streets at last became quiet, and the patrol, the officers of\r\n",
      "which, in their splendid costumes, and surrounded by their suites,\r\n",
      "Passepartout thought seemed like ambassadors, succeeded the bustling\r\n",
      "crowd.  Each time a company passed, Passepartout chuckled, and said to\r\n",
      "himself: \"Good! another Japanese embassy departing for Europe!\"\r\n",

      "that he must get something to eat at all hazards, and the sooner he did\r\n",
      "so the better.  He might, indeed, sell his watch; but he would have\r\n",
      "starved first.  Now or never he must use the strong, if not melodious\r\n",
      "voice which nature had bestowed upon him.  He knew several French and\r\n",
      "English songs, and resolved to try them upon the Japanese, who must be\r\n",
      "lovers of music, since they were for ever pounding on their cymbals,\r\n",

      "dressed for a wandering artist.  The idea struck him to change his\r\n",
      "garments for clothes more in harmony with his project; by which he\r\n",

      "He followed the clown, and soon found himself once more in the Japanese\r\n",
      "quarter.  A quarter of an hour later he stopped before a large cabin,\r\n",
      "adorned with several clusters of streamers, the exterior walls of which\r\n",
      "were designed to represent, in violent colours and without perspective,\r\n",
      "a company of jugglers.\r\n",

      "This was the Honourable William Batulcar's establishment.  That\r\n",

      "\"Would you like a servant, sir?\" asked Passepartout.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "see, my friend, in France they exhibit foreign clowns, and in foreign\r\n",
      "parts French clowns.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You are pretty strong, eh?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Especially after a good meal.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And you can sing?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" returned Passepartout, who had formerly been wont to sing in the\r\n",
      "streets.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But can you sing standing on your head, with a top spinning on your\r\n",
      "left foot, and a sabre balanced on your right?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Humph!  I think so,\" replied Passepartout, recalling the exercises of\r\n",
      "his younger days.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, that's enough,\" said the Honourable William Batulcar.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The engagement was concluded there and then.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout had at last found something to do.  He was engaged to act\r\n",
      "in the celebrated Japanese troupe.  It was not a very dignified\r\n",
      "position, but within a week he would be on his way to San Francisco.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The performance, so noisily announced by the Honourable Mr. Batulcar,\r\n",
      "was to commence at three o'clock, and soon the deafening instruments of\r\n",
      "a Japanese orchestra resounded at the door.  Passepartout, though he\r\n",
      "had not been able to study or rehearse a part, was designated to lend\r\n",
      "the aid of his sturdy shoulders in the great exhibition of the \"human\r\n",
      "pyramid,\" executed by the Long Noses of the god Tingou.  This \"great\r\n",
      "attraction\" was to close the performance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Before three o'clock the large shed was invaded by the spectators,\r\n",
      "comprising Europeans and natives, Chinese and Japanese, men, women and\r\n",
      "children, who precipitated themselves upon the narrow benches and into\r\n",
      "the boxes opposite the stage.  The musicians took up a position inside,\r\n",
      "and were vigorously performing on their gongs, tam-tams, flutes, bones,\r\n",
      "tambourines, and immense drums.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The performance was much like all acrobatic displays; but it must be\r\n",
      "confessed that the Japanese are the first equilibrists in the world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One, with a fan and some bits of paper, performed the graceful trick of\r\n",
      "the butterflies and the flowers; another traced in the air, with the\r\n",
      "odorous smoke of his pipe, a series of blue words, which composed a\r\n",
      "compliment to the audience; while a third juggled with some lighted\r\n",
      "candles, which he extinguished successively as they passed his lips,\r\n",
      "and relit again without interrupting for an instant his juggling.\r\n",
      "Another reproduced the most singular combinations with a spinning-top;\r\n",
      "in his hands the revolving tops seemed to be animated with a life of\r\n",
      "their own in their interminable whirling; they ran over pipe-stems, the\r\n",
      "edges of sabres, wires and even hairs stretched across the stage; they\r\n",
      "turned around on the edges of large glasses, crossed bamboo ladders,\r\n",
      "dispersed into all the corners, and produced strange musical effects by\r\n",
      "the combination of their various pitches of tone.  The jugglers tossed\r\n",
      "them in the air, threw them like shuttlecocks with wooden battledores,\r\n",
      "and yet they kept on spinning; they put them into their pockets, and\r\n",
      "took them out still whirling as before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is useless to describe the astonishing performances of the acrobats\r\n",
      "and gymnasts.  The turning on ladders, poles, balls, barrels, &amp;c., was\r\n",
      "executed with wonderful precision.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the principal attraction was the exhibition of the Long Noses, a\r\n",
      "show to which Europe is as yet a stranger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Long Noses form a peculiar company, under the direct patronage of\r\n",
      "the god Tingou.  Attired after the fashion of the Middle Ages, they\r\n",
      "bore upon their shoulders a splendid pair of wings; but what especially\r\n",
      "distinguished them was the long noses which were fastened to their\r\n",
      "faces, and the uses which they made of them.  These noses were made of\r\n",
      "bamboo, and were five, six, and even ten feet long, some straight,\r\n",
      "others curved, some ribboned, and some having imitation warts upon\r\n",
      "them.  It was upon these appendages, fixed tightly on their real noses,\r\n",
      "that they performed their gymnastic exercises.  A dozen of these\r\n",
      "sectaries of Tingou lay flat upon their backs, while others, dressed to\r\n",
      "represent lightning-rods, came and frolicked on their noses, jumping\r\n",
      "from one to another, and performing the most skilful leapings and\r\n",
      "somersaults.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As a last scene, a \"human pyramid\" had been announced, in which fifty\r\n",
      "Long Noses were to represent the Car of Juggernaut.  But, instead of\r\n",
      "forming a pyramid by mounting each other's shoulders, the artists were\r\n",
      "to group themselves on top of the noses.  It happened that the\r\n",
      "performer who had hitherto formed the base of the Car had quitted the\r\n",
      "troupe, and as, to fill this part, only strength and adroitness were\r\n",
      "necessary, Passepartout had been chosen to take his place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The poor fellow really felt sad when--melancholy reminiscence of his\r\n",
      "youth!--he donned his costume, adorned with vari-coloured wings, and\r\n",
      "fastened to his natural feature a false nose six feet long.  But he\r\n",
      "cheered up when he thought that this nose was winning him something to\r\n",
      "eat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went upon the stage, and took his place beside the rest who were to\r\n",
      "compose the base of the Car of Juggernaut.  They all stretched\r\n",
      "themselves on the floor, their noses pointing to the ceiling.  A second\r\n",
      "group of artists disposed themselves on these long appendages, then a\r\n",
      "third above these, then a fourth, until a human monument reaching to\r\n",
      "the very cornices of the theatre soon arose on top of the noses.  This\r\n",
      "elicited loud applause, in the midst of which the orchestra was just\r\n",
      "striking up a deafening air, when the pyramid tottered, the balance was\r\n",
      "lost, one of the lower noses vanished from the pyramid, and the human\r\n",
      "monument was shattered like a castle built of cards!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was Passepartout's fault.  Abandoning his position, clearing the\r\n",
      "footlights without the aid of his wings, and, clambering up to the\r\n",
      "right-hand gallery, he fell at the feet of one of the spectators,\r\n",
      "crying, \"Ah, my master! my master!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You here?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Myself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very well; then let us go to the steamer, young man!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout passed through the lobby of the\r\n",
      "theatre to the outside, where they encountered the Honourable Mr.\r\n",
      "Batulcar, furious with rage.  He demanded damages for the \"breakage\" of\r\n",
      "the pyramid; and Phileas Fogg appeased him by giving him a handful of\r\n",
      "banknotes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At half-past six, the very hour of departure, Mr. Fogg and Aouda,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "What happened when the pilot-boat came in sight of Shanghai will be\r\n",
      "easily guessed.  The signals made by the Tankadere had been seen by the\r\n",
      "captain of the Yokohama steamer, who, espying the flag at half-mast,\r\n",
      "had directed his course towards the little craft.  Phileas Fogg, after\r\n",
      "paying the stipulated price of his passage to John Busby, and rewarding\r\n",
      "that worthy with the additional sum of five hundred and fifty pounds,\r\n",

      "Nagasaki and Yokohama.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They reached their destination on the morning of the 14th of November.\r\n",
      "Phileas Fogg lost no time in going on board the Carnatic, where he\r\n",
      "learned, to Aouda's great delight--and perhaps to his own, though he\r\n",
      "betrayed no emotion--that Passepartout, a Frenchman, had really arrived\r\n",
      "on her the day before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The San Francisco steamer was announced to leave that very evening, and\r\n",
      "it became necessary to find Passepartout, if possible, without delay.\r\n",
      "Mr. Fogg applied in vain to the French and English consuls, and, after\r\n",
      "wandering through the streets a long time, began to despair of finding\r\n",
      "his missing servant.  Chance, or perhaps a kind of presentiment, at\r\n",
      "last led him into the Honourable Mr. Batulcar's theatre.  He certainly\r\n",
      "would not have recognised Passepartout in the eccentric mountebank's\r\n",
      "costume; but the latter, lying on his back, perceived his master in the\r\n",
      "gallery.  He could not help starting, which so changed the position of\r\n",
      "his nose as to bring the \"pyramid\" pell-mell upon the stage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All this Passepartout learned from Aouda, who recounted to him what had\r\n",
      "taken place on the voyage from Hong Kong to Shanghai on the Tankadere,\r\n",
      "in company with one Mr. Fix.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout did not change countenance on hearing this name.  He\r\n",
      "thought that the time had not yet arrived to divulge to his master what\r\n",
      "had taken place between the detective and himself; and, in the account\r\n",
      "he gave of his absence, he simply excused himself for having been\r\n",
      "overtaken by drunkenness, in smoking opium at a tavern in Hong Kong.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Fogg heard this narrative coldly, without a word; and then\r\n",
      "furnished his man with funds necessary to obtain clothing more in\r\n",
      "harmony with his position.  Within an hour the Frenchman had cut off\r\n",
      "his nose and parted with his wings, and retained nothing about him\r\n",
      "which recalled the sectary of the god Tingou.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The steamer which was about to depart from Yokohama to San Francisco\r\n",
      "belonged to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, and was named the\r\n",
      "General Grant.  She was a large paddle-wheel steamer of two thousand\r\n",
      "five hundred tons; well equipped and very fast.  The massive\r\n",
      "walking-beam rose and fell above the deck; at one end a piston-rod\r\n",
      "worked up and down; and at the other was a connecting-rod which, in\r\n",
      "changing the rectilinear motion to a circular one, was directly\r\n",
      "connected with the shaft of the paddles.  The General Grant was rigged\r\n",
      "with three masts, giving a large capacity for sails, and thus\r\n",
      "materially aiding the steam power.  By making twelve miles an hour, she\r\n",
      "would cross the ocean in twenty-one days.  Phileas Fogg was therefore\r\n",
      "justified in hoping that he would reach San Francisco by the 2nd of\r\n",
      "December, New York by the 11th, and London on the 20th--thus gaining\r\n",
      "several hours on the fatal date of the 21st of December.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a full complement of passengers on board, among them English,\r\n",
      "many Americans, a large number of coolies on their way to California,\r\n",
      "and several East Indian officers, who were spending their vacation in\r\n",
      "making the tour of the world.  Nothing of moment happened on the\r\n",
      "voyage; the steamer, sustained on its large paddles, rolled but little,\r\n",
      "and the Pacific almost justified its name.  Mr. Fogg was as calm and\r\n",
      "taciturn as ever.  His young companion felt herself more and more\r\n",
      "attached to him by other ties than gratitude; his silent but generous\r\n",
      "nature impressed her more than she thought; and it was almost\r\n",
      "unconsciously that she yielded to emotions which did not seem to have\r\n",
      "the least effect upon her protector.  Aouda took the keenest interest\r\n",
      "in his plans, and became impatient at any incident which seemed likely\r\n",
      "to retard his journey.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She often chatted with Passepartout, who did not fail to perceive the\r\n",
      "state of the lady's heart; and, being the most faithful of domestics,\r\n",
      "he never exhausted his eulogies of Phileas Fogg's honesty, generosity,\r\n",
      "and devotion.  He took pains to calm Aouda's doubts of a successful\r\n",
      "termination of the journey, telling her that the most difficult part of\r\n",
      "it had passed, that now they were beyond the fantastic countries of\r\n",
      "Japan and China, and were fairly on their way to civilised places\r\n",
      "again.  A railway train from San Francisco to New York, and a\r\n",
      "transatlantic steamer from New York to Liverpool, would doubtless bring\r\n",
      "them to the end of this impossible journey round the world within the\r\n",
      "period agreed upon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the ninth day after leaving Yokohama, Phileas Fogg had traversed\r\n",
      "exactly one half of the terrestrial globe.  The General Grant passed,\r\n",
      "on the 23rd of November, the one hundred and eightieth meridian, and\r\n",
      "was at the very antipodes of London.  Mr. Fogg had, it is true,\r\n",
      "exhausted fifty-two of the eighty days in which he was to complete the\r\n",
      "tour, and there were only twenty-eight left.  But, though he was only\r\n",
      "half-way by the difference of meridians, he had really gone over\r\n",
      "two-thirds of the whole journey; for he had been obliged to make long\r\n",
      "circuits from London to Aden, from Aden to Bombay, from Calcutta to\r\n",
      "Singapore, and from Singapore to Yokohama.  Could he have followed\r\n",
      "without deviation the fiftieth parallel, which is that of London, the\r\n",
      "whole distance would only have been about twelve thousand miles;\r\n",
      "whereas he would be forced, by the irregular methods of locomotion, to\r\n",
      "traverse twenty-six thousand, of which he had, on the 23rd of November,\r\n",
      "accomplished seventeen thousand five hundred.  And now the course was a\r\n",
      "straight one, and Fix was no longer there to put obstacles in their way!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It happened also, on the 23rd of November, that Passepartout made a\r\n",
      "joyful discovery.  It will be remembered that the obstinate fellow had\r\n",
      "insisted on keeping his famous family watch at London time, and on\r\n",
      "regarding that of the countries he had passed through as quite false\r\n",
      "and unreliable.  Now, on this day, though he had not changed the hands,\r\n",
      "he found that his watch exactly agreed with the ship's chronometers.\r\n",
      "His triumph was hilarious.  He would have liked to know what Fix would\r\n",
      "say if he were aboard!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The rogue told me a lot of stories,\" repeated Passepartout, \"about the\r\n",
      "meridians, the sun, and the moon!  Moon, indeed!  moonshine more\r\n",
      "likely!  If one listened to that sort of people, a pretty sort of time\r\n",
      "one would keep!  I was sure that the sun would some day regulate itself\r\n",
      "by my watch!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout was ignorant that, if the face of his watch had been\r\n",
      "divided into twenty-four hours, like the Italian clocks, he would have\r\n",
      "no reason for exultation; for the hands of his watch would then,\r\n",
      "instead of as now indicating nine o'clock in the morning, indicate nine\r\n",
      "o'clock in the evening, that is, the twenty-first hour after midnight\r\n",
      "precisely the difference between London time and that of the one\r\n",
      "hundred and eightieth meridian.  But if Fix had been able to explain\r\n",
      "this purely physical effect, Passepartout would not have admitted, even\r\n",
      "if he had comprehended it.  Moreover, if the detective had been on\r\n",
      "board at that moment, Passepartout would have joined issue with him on\r\n",
      "a quite different subject, and in an entirely different manner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Where was Fix at that moment?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was actually on board the General Grant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On reaching Yokohama, the detective, leaving Mr. Fogg, whom he expected\r\n",
      "to meet again during the day, had repaired at once to the English\r\n",
      "consulate, where he at last found the warrant of arrest.  It had\r\n",
      "followed him from Bombay, and had come by the Carnatic, on which\r\n",
      "steamer he himself was supposed to be.  Fix's disappointment may be\r\n",
      "imagined when he reflected that the warrant was now useless.  Mr. Fogg\r\n",
      "had left English ground, and it was now necessary to procure his\r\n",
      "extradition!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" thought Fix, after a moment of anger, \"my warrant is not good\r\n",
      "here, but it will be in England.  The rogue evidently intends to return\r\n",
      "to his own country, thinking he has thrown the police off his track.\r\n",
      "Good!  I will follow him across the Atlantic.  As for the money, heaven\r\n",
      "grant there may be some left!  But the fellow has already spent in\r\n",
      "travelling, rewards, trials, bail, elephants, and all sorts of charges,\r\n",
      "more than five thousand pounds.  Yet, after all, the Bank is rich!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His course decided on, he went on board the General Grant, and was\r\n",
      "there when Mr. Fogg and Aouda arrived.  To his utter amazement, he\r\n",
      "recognised Passepartout, despite his theatrical disguise.  He quickly\r\n",
      "concealed himself in his cabin, to avoid an awkward explanation, and\r\n",
      "hoped--thanks to the number of passengers--to remain unperceived by Mr.\r\n",
      "Fogg's servant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On that very day, however, he met Passepartout face to face on the\r\n",
      "forward deck.  The latter, without a word, made a rush for him, grasped\r\n",
      "him by the throat, and, much to the amusement of a group of Americans,\r\n",
      "who immediately began to bet on him, administered to the detective a\r\n",
      "perfect volley of blows, which proved the great superiority of French\r\n",
      "over English pugilistic skill.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Passepartout had finished, he found himself relieved and\r\n",
      "comforted.  Fix got up in a somewhat rumpled condition, and, looking at\r\n",
      "his adversary, coldly said, \"Have you done?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For this time--yes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then let me have a word with you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But I--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In your master's interests.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout seemed to be vanquished by Fix's coolness, for he quietly\r\n",
      "followed him, and they sat down aside from the rest of the passengers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You have given me a thrashing,\" said Fix.  \"Good, I expected it.  Now,\r\n",
      "listen to me.  Up to this time I have been Mr. Fogg's adversary.  I am\r\n",
      "now in his game.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Aha!\" cried Passepartout; \"you are convinced he is an honest man?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No,\" replied Fix coldly, \"I think him a rascal.  Sh! don't budge, and\r\n",
      "let me speak.  As long as Mr. Fogg was on English ground, it was for my\r\n",
      "interest to detain him there until my warrant of arrest arrived.  I did\r\n",
      "everything I could to keep him back.  I sent the Bombay priests after\r\n",
      "him, I got you intoxicated at Hong Kong, I separated you from him, and\r\n",
      "I made him miss the Yokohama steamer.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout listened, with closed fists.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now,\" resumed Fix, \"Mr. Fogg seems to be going back to England.  Well,\r\n",
      "I will follow him there.  But hereafter I will do as much to keep\r\n",
      "obstacles out of his way as I have done up to this time to put them in\r\n",
      "his path.  I've changed my game, you see, and simply because it was for\r\n",
      "my interest to change it.  Your interest is the same as mine; for it is\r\n",
      "only in England that you will ascertain whether you are in the service\r\n",

      "foot upon the American continent, if this name can be given to the\r\n",
      "floating quay upon which they disembarked.  These quays, rising and\r\n",
      "falling with the tide, thus facilitate the loading and unloading of\r\n",
      "vessels.  Alongside them were clippers of all sizes, steamers of all\r\n",
      "nationalities, and the steamboats, with several decks rising one above\r\n",
      "the other, which ply on the Sacramento and its tributaries.  There were\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout, in his joy on reaching at last the American continent,\r\n",
      "thought he would manifest it by executing a perilous vault in fine\r\n",
      "style; but, tumbling upon some worm-eaten planks, he fell through them.\r\n",
      "Put out of countenance by the manner in which he thus \"set foot\" upon\r\n",

      "innumerable cormorants and pelicans that are always perched upon these\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Fogg, on reaching shore, proceeded to find out at what hour the\r\n",
      "first train left for New York, and learned that this was at six o'clock\r\n",
      "p.m.; he had, therefore, an entire day to spend in the Californian\r\n",
      "capital.  Taking a carriage at a charge of three dollars, he and Aouda\r\n",
      "entered it, while Passepartout mounted the box beside the driver, and\r\n",
      "they set out for the International Hotel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From his exalted position Passepartout observed with much curiosity the\r\n",
      "wide streets, the low, evenly ranged houses, the Anglo-Saxon Gothic\r\n",
      "churches, the great docks, the palatial wooden and brick warehouses,\r\n",
      "the numerous conveyances, omnibuses, horse-cars, and upon the\r\n",
      "side-walks, not only Americans and Europeans, but Chinese and Indians.\r\n",
      "Passepartout was surprised at all he saw.  San Francisco was no longer\r\n",
      "the legendary city of 1849--a city of banditti, assassins, and\r\n",
      "incendiaries, who had flocked hither in crowds in pursuit of plunder; a\r\n",
      "paradise of outlaws, where they gambled with gold-dust, a revolver in\r\n",
      "one hand and a bowie-knife in the other: it was now a great commercial\r\n",
      "emporium.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lofty tower of its City Hall overlooked the whole panorama of the\r\n",
      "streets and avenues, which cut each other at right-angles, and in the\r\n",
      "midst of which appeared pleasant, verdant squares, while beyond\r\n",
      "appeared the Chinese quarter, seemingly imported from the Celestial\r\n",
      "Empire in a toy-box.  Sombreros and red shirts and plumed Indians were\r\n",
      "rarely to be seen; but there were silk hats and black coats everywhere\r\n",
      "worn by a multitude of nervously active, gentlemanly-looking men.  Some\r\n",
      "of the streets--especially Montgomery Street, which is to San Francisco\r\n",
      "what Regent Street is to London, the Boulevard des Italiens to Paris,\r\n",
      "and Broadway to New York--were lined with splendid and spacious\r\n",
      "stores, which exposed in their windows the products of the entire world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Passepartout reached the International Hotel, it did not seem to\r\n",
      "him as if he had left England at all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The ground floor of the hotel was occupied by a large bar, a sort of\r\n",
      "restaurant freely open to all passers-by, who might partake of dried\r\n",
      "beef, oyster soup, biscuits, and cheese, without taking out their\r\n",
      "purses.  Payment was made only for the ale, porter, or sherry which was\r\n",
      "drunk.  This seemed \"very American\" to Passepartout.  The hotel\r\n",
      "refreshment-rooms were comfortable, and Mr. Fogg and Aouda, installing\r\n",
      "themselves at a table, were abundantly served on diminutive plates by\r\n",
      "negroes of darkest hue.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After breakfast, Mr. Fogg, accompanied by Aouda, started for the\r\n",
      "English consulate to have his passport visaed.  As he was going out, he\r\n",
      "met Passepartout, who asked him if it would not be well, before taking\r\n",
      "the train, to purchase some dozens of Enfield rifles and Colt's\r\n",
      "revolvers.  He had been listening to stories of attacks upon the trains\r\n",
      "by the Sioux and Pawnees.  Mr. Fogg thought it a useless precaution,\r\n",
      "but told him to do as he thought best, and went on to the consulate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had not proceeded two hundred steps, however, when, \"by the greatest\r\n",
      "chance in the world,\" he met Fix.  The detective seemed wholly taken by\r\n",
      "surprise.  What!  Had Mr. Fogg and himself crossed the Pacific\r\n",
      "together, and not met on the steamer!  At least Fix felt honoured to\r\n",
      "behold once more the gentleman to whom he owed so much, and, as his\r\n",
      "business recalled him to Europe, he should be delighted to continue the\r\n",
      "journey in such pleasant company.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Fogg replied that the honour would be his; and the detective--who\r\n",
      "was determined not to lose sight of him--begged permission to accompany\r\n",
      "them in their walk about San Francisco--a request which Mr. Fogg\r\n",
      "readily granted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They soon found themselves in Montgomery Street, where a great crowd\r\n",
      "was collected; the side-walks, street, horsecar rails, the shop-doors,\r\n",
      "the windows of the houses, and even the roofs, were full of people.\r\n",
      "Men were going about carrying large posters, and flags and streamers\r\n",
      "were floating in the wind; while loud cries were heard on every hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hurrah for Camerfield!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hurrah for Mandiboy!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a political meeting; at least so Fix conjectured, who said to\r\n",
      "Mr. Fogg, \"Perhaps we had better not mingle with the crowd.  There may\r\n",
      "be danger in it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" returned Mr. Fogg; \"and blows, even if they are political are\r\n",
      "still blows.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fix smiled at this remark; and, in order to be able to see without\r\n",
      "being jostled about, the party took up a position on the top of a\r\n",
      "flight of steps situated at the upper end of Montgomery Street.\r\n",
      "Opposite them, on the other side of the street, between a coal wharf\r\n",
      "and a petroleum warehouse, a large platform had been erected in the\r\n",
      "open air, towards which the current of the crowd seemed to be directed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For what purpose was this meeting?  What was the occasion of this\r\n",
      "excited assemblage?  Phileas Fogg could not imagine.  Was it to\r\n",
      "nominate some high official--a governor or member of Congress?  It was\r\n",
      "not improbable, so agitated was the multitude before them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Just at this moment there was an unusual stir in the human mass.  All\r\n",
      "the hands were raised in the air.  Some, tightly closed, seemed to\r\n",
      "disappear suddenly in the midst of the cries--an energetic way, no\r\n",
      "doubt, of casting a vote.  The crowd swayed back, the banners and flags\r\n",
      "wavered, disappeared an instant, then reappeared in tatters.  The\r\n",
      "undulations of the human surge reached the steps, while all the heads\r\n",
      "floundered on the surface like a sea agitated by a squall.  Many of the\r\n",
      "black hats disappeared, and the greater part of the crowd seemed to\r\n",
      "have diminished in height.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It is evidently a meeting,\" said Fix, \"and its object must be an\r\n",
      "exciting one.  I should not wonder if it were about the Alabama,\r\n",
      "despite the fact that that question is settled.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Perhaps,\" replied Mr. Fogg, simply.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"At least, there are two champions in presence of each other, the\r\n",
      "Honourable Mr. Camerfield and the Honourable Mr. Mandiboy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Aouda, leaning upon Mr. Fogg's arm, observed the tumultuous scene with\r\n",
      "surprise, while Fix asked a man near him what the cause of it all was.\r\n",
      "Before the man could reply, a fresh agitation arose; hurrahs and\r\n",
      "excited shouts were heard; the staffs of the banners began to be used\r\n",
      "as offensive weapons; and fists flew about in every direction.  Thumps\r\n",
      "were exchanged from the tops of the carriages and omnibuses which had\r\n",
      "been blocked up in the crowd.  Boots and shoes went whirling through\r\n",
      "the air, and Mr. Fogg thought he even heard the crack of revolvers\r\n",
      "mingling in the din, the rout approached the stairway, and flowed over\r\n",
      "the lower step.  One of the parties had evidently been repulsed; but\r\n",
      "the mere lookers-on could not tell whether Mandiboy or Camerfield had\r\n",
      "gained the upper hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It would be prudent for us to retire,\" said Fix, who was anxious that\r\n",
      "Mr. Fogg should not receive any injury, at least until they got back to\r\n",
      "London.  \"If there is any question about England in all this, and we\r\n",
      "were recognised, I fear it would go hard with us.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"An English subject--\" began Mr. Fogg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He did not finish his sentence; for a terrific hubbub now arose on the\r\n",
      "terrace behind the flight of steps where they stood, and there were\r\n",
      "frantic shouts of, \"Hurrah for Mandiboy!  Hip, hip, hurrah!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a band of voters coming to the rescue of their allies, and\r\n",
      "taking the Camerfield forces in flank.  Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Fix found\r\n",
      "themselves between two fires; it was too late to escape.  The torrent\r\n",
      "of men, armed with loaded canes and sticks, was irresistible.  Phileas\r\n",
      "Fogg and Fix were roughly hustled in their attempts to protect their\r\n",
      "fair companion; the former, as cool as ever, tried to defend himself\r\n",
      "with the weapons which nature has placed at the end of every\r\n",
      "Englishman's arm, but in vain.  A big brawny fellow with a red beard,\r\n",
      "flushed face, and broad shoulders, who seemed to be the chief of the\r\n",
      "band, raised his clenched fist to strike Mr. Fogg, whom he would have\r\n",
      "given a crushing blow, had not Fix rushed in and received it in his\r\n",
      "stead.  An enormous bruise immediately made its appearance under the\r\n",
      "detective's silk hat, which was completely smashed in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yankee!\" exclaimed Mr. Fogg, darting a contemptuous look at the\r\n",
      "ruffian.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Englishman!\" returned the other.  \"We will meet again!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"When you please.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What is your name?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Phileas Fogg.  And yours?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Colonel Stamp Proctor.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The human tide now swept by, after overturning Fix, who speedily got\r\n",
      "upon his feet again, though with tattered clothes.  Happily, he was not\r\n",
      "seriously hurt.  His travelling overcoat was divided into two unequal\r\n",
      "parts, and his trousers resembled those of certain Indians, which fit\r\n",
      "less compactly than they are easy to put on.  Aouda had escaped\r\n",
      "unharmed, and Fix alone bore marks of the fray in his black and blue\r\n",
      "bruise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thanks,\" said Mr. Fogg to the detective, as soon as they were out of\r\n",
      "the crowd.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No thanks are necessary,\" replied.  Fix; \"but let us go.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To a tailor's.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Such a visit was, indeed, opportune.  The clothing of both Mr. Fogg and\r\n",
      "Fix was in rags, as if they had themselves been actively engaged in the\r\n",
      "contest between Camerfield and Mandiboy.  An hour after, they were once\r\n",
      "more suitably attired, and with Aouda returned to the International\r\n",
      "Hotel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout was waiting for his master, armed with half a dozen\r\n",
      "six-barrelled revolvers.  When he perceived Fix, he knit his brows; but\r\n",
      "Aouda having, in a few words, told him of their adventure, his\r\n",
      "countenance resumed its placid expression.  Fix evidently was no longer\r\n",
      "an enemy, but an ally; he was faithfully keeping his word.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dinner over, the coach which was to convey the passengers and their\r\n",
      "luggage to the station drew up to the door.  As he was getting in, Mr.\r\n",
      "Fogg said to Fix, \"You have not seen this Colonel Proctor again?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I will come back to America to find him,\" said Phileas Fogg calmly.\r\n",
      "\"It would not be right for an Englishman to permit himself to be\r\n",
      "treated in that way, without retaliating.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The detective smiled, but did not reply.  It was clear that Mr. Fogg\r\n",
      "was one of those Englishmen who, while they do not tolerate duelling at\r\n",
      "home, fight abroad when their honour is attacked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At a quarter before six the travellers reached the station, and found\r\n",
      "the train ready to depart.  As he was about to enter it, Mr. Fogg\r\n",
      "called a porter, and said to him: \"My friend, was there not some\r\n",
      "trouble to-day in San Francisco?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It was a political meeting, sir,\" replied the porter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But I thought there was a great deal of disturbance in the streets.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It was only a meeting assembled for an election.\"\r\n",

      "however, really divided into two distinct lines: the Central Pacific,\r\n",
      "between San Francisco and Ogden, and the Union Pacific, between Ogden\r\n",
      "and Omaha.  Five main lines connect Omaha with New York.\r\n",

      "New York and San Francisco are thus united by an uninterrupted metal\r\n",
      "ribbon, which measures no less than three thousand seven hundred and\r\n",
      "eighty-six miles.  Between Omaha and the Pacific the railway crosses a\r\n",
      "territory which is still infested by Indians and wild beasts, and a\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It was in 1862 that, in spite of the Southern Members of Congress, who\r\n",
      "wished a more southerly route, it was decided to lay the road between\r\n",
      "the forty-first and forty-second parallels.  President Lincoln himself\r\n",
      "fixed the end of the line at Omaha, in Nebraska.  The work was at once\r\n",
      "commenced, and pursued with true American energy; nor did the rapidity\r\n",
      "with which it went on injuriously affect its good execution.  The road\r\n",
      "grew, on the prairies, a mile and a half a day.  A locomotive, running\r\n",
      "on the rails laid down the evening before, brought the rails to be laid\r\n",

      "side of an aisle which conducted to the front and rear platforms.\r\n",
      "These platforms were found throughout the train, and the passengers\r\n",

      "No one ventured to gainsay the missionary, whose excited tone\r\n",
      "contrasted curiously with his naturally calm visage.  No doubt his\r\n",
      "anger arose from the hardships to which the Mormons were actually\r\n",
      "subjected.  The government had just succeeded, with some difficulty, in\r\n",
      "reducing these independent fanatics to its rule.  It had made itself\r\n",
      "master of Utah, and subjected that territory to the laws of the Union,\r\n",
      "after imprisoning Brigham Young on a charge of rebellion and polygamy.\r\n",
      "The disciples of the prophet had since redoubled their efforts, and\r\n",
      "resisted, by words at least, the authority of Congress.  Elder Hitch,\r\n",
      "as is seen, was trying to make proselytes on the very railway trains.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then, emphasising his words with his loud voice and frequent gestures,\r\n",
      "he related the history of the Mormons from Biblical times: how that, in\r\n",
      "Israel, a Mormon prophet of the tribe of Joseph published the annals of\r\n",
      "the new religion, and bequeathed them to his son Mormon; how, many\r\n",
      "centuries later, a translation of this precious book, which was written\r\n",
      "in Egyptian, was made by Joseph Smith, junior, a Vermont farmer, who\r\n",
      "revealed himself as a mystical prophet in 1825; and how, in short, the\r\n",
      "celestial messenger appeared to him in an illuminated forest, and gave\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Several of the audience, not being much interested in the missionary's\r\n",
      "narrative, here left the car; but Elder Hitch, continuing his lecture,\r\n",
      "related how Smith, junior, with his father, two brothers, and a few\r\n",
      "disciples, founded the church of the \"Latter Day Saints,\" which,\r\n",
      "adopted not only in America, but in England, Norway and Sweden, and\r\n",
      "Germany, counts many artisans, as well as men engaged in the liberal\r\n",
      "professions, among its members; how a colony was established in Ohio, a\r\n",
      "temple erected there at a cost of two hundred thousand dollars, and a\r\n",
      "town built at Kirkland; how Smith became an enterprising banker, and\r\n",

      "Abraham and several famous Egyptians.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "gradually less, until it was reduced to twenty passengers.  But this\r\n",
      "did not disconcert the enthusiast, who proceeded with the story of\r\n",
      "Joseph Smith's bankruptcy in 1837, and how his ruined creditors gave\r\n",
      "him a coat of tar and feathers; his reappearance some years afterwards,\r\n",
      "more honourable and honoured than ever, at Independence, Missouri, the\r\n",

      "pursuit thence by outraged Gentiles, and retirement into the Far West.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "listening with all his ears.  Thus he learned that, after long\r\n",
      "persecutions, Smith reappeared in Illinois, and in 1839 founded a\r\n",
      "community at Nauvoo, on the Mississippi, numbering twenty-five thousand\r\n",
      "souls, of which he became mayor, chief justice, and general-in-chief;\r\n",
      "that he announced himself, in 1843, as a candidate for the Presidency\r\n",
      "of the United States; and that finally, being drawn into ambuscade at\r\n",
      "Carthage, he was thrown into prison, and assassinated by a band of men\r\n",
      "disguised in masks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout was now the only person left in the car, and the Elder,\r\n",
      "looking him full in the face, reminded him that, two years after the\r\n",
      "assassination of Joseph Smith, the inspired prophet, Brigham Young, his\r\n",
      "successor, left Nauvoo for the banks of the Great Salt Lake, where, in\r\n",
      "the midst of that fertile region, directly on the route of the\r\n",
      "emigrants who crossed Utah on their way to California, the new colony,\r\n",
      "thanks to the polygamy practised by the Mormons, had flourished beyond\r\n",
      "expectations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And this,\" added Elder William Hitch, \"this is why the jealousy of\r\n",
      "Congress has been aroused against us!  Why have the soldiers of the\r\n",
      "Union invaded the soil of Utah?  Why has Brigham Young, our chief, been\r\n",
      "imprisoned, in contempt of all justice?  Shall we yield to force?\r\n",
      "Never!  Driven from Vermont, driven from Illinois, driven from Ohio,\r\n",
      "driven from Missouri, driven from Utah, we shall yet find some\r\n",
      "independent territory on which to plant our tents.  And you, my\r\n",
      "brother,\" continued the Elder, fixing his angry eyes upon his single\r\n",
      "auditor, \"will you not plant yours there, too, under the shadow of our\r\n",
      "flag?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "During the lecture the train had been making good progress, and towards\r\n",
      "half-past twelve it reached the northwest border of the Great Salt\r\n",
      "Lake.  Thence the passengers could observe the vast extent of this\r\n",
      "interior sea, which is also called the Dead Sea, and into which flows\r\n",
      "an American Jordan.  It is a picturesque expanse, framed in lofty crags\r\n",
      "in large strata, encrusted with white salt--a superb sheet of water,\r\n",
      "which was formerly of larger extent than now, its shores having\r\n",
      "encroached with the lapse of time, and thus at once reduced its breadth\r\n",
      "and increased its depth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Salt Lake, seventy miles long and thirty-five wide, is situated\r\n",
      "three miles eight hundred feet above the sea.  Quite different from\r\n",
      "Lake Asphaltite, whose depression is twelve hundred feet below the sea,\r\n",
      "it contains considerable salt, and one quarter of the weight of its\r\n",
      "water is solid matter, its specific weight being 1,170, and, after\r\n",
      "being distilled, 1,000.  Fishes are, of course, unable to live in it,\r\n",
      "and those which descend through the Jordan, the Weber, and other\r\n",
      "streams soon perish.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The country around the lake was well cultivated, for the Mormons are\r\n",
      "mostly farmers; while ranches and pens for domesticated animals, fields\r\n",
      "of wheat, corn, and other cereals, luxuriant prairies, hedges of wild\r\n",
      "rose, clumps of acacias and milk-wort, would have been seen six months\r\n",
      "later.  Now the ground was covered with a thin powdering of snow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The train reached Ogden at two o'clock, where it rested for six hours,\r\n",
      "Mr. Fogg and his party had time to pay a visit to Salt Lake City,\r\n",
      "connected with Ogden by a branch road; and they spent two hours in this\r\n",
      "strikingly American town, built on the pattern of other cities of the\r\n",
      "Union, like a checker-board, \"with the sombre sadness of right-angles,\"\r\n",
      "as Victor Hugo expresses it.  The founder of the City of the Saints\r\n",
      "could not escape from the taste for symmetry which distinguishes the\r\n",
      "Anglo-Saxons.  In this strange country, where the people are certainly\r\n",
      "not up to the level of their institutions, everything is done\r\n",
      "\"squarely\"--cities, houses, and follies.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The travellers, then, were promenading, at three o'clock, about the\r\n",
      "streets of the town built between the banks of the Jordan and the spurs\r\n",
      "of the Wahsatch Range.  They saw few or no churches, but the prophet's\r\n",
      "mansion, the court-house, and the arsenal, blue-brick houses with\r\n",
      "verandas and porches, surrounded by gardens bordered with acacias,\r\n",
      "palms, and locusts.  A clay and pebble wall, built in 1853, surrounded\r\n",
      "the town; and in the principal street were the market and several\r\n",
      "hotels adorned with pavilions.  The place did not seem thickly\r\n",
      "populated.  The streets were almost deserted, except in the vicinity of\r\n",
      "the temple, which they only reached after having traversed several\r\n",
      "quarters surrounded by palisades.  There were many women, which was\r\n",
      "easily accounted for by the \"peculiar institution\" of the Mormons; but\r\n",
      "it must not be supposed that all the Mormons are polygamists.  They are\r\n",
      "free to marry or not, as they please; but it is worth noting that it is\r\n",
      "mainly the female citizens of Utah who are anxious to marry, as,\r\n",
      "according to the Mormon religion, maiden ladies are not admitted to the\r\n",
      "possession of its highest joys.  These poor creatures seemed to be\r\n",
      "neither well off nor happy.  Some--the more well-to-do, no doubt--wore\r\n",
      "short, open, black silk dresses, under a hood or modest shawl; others\r\n",
      "were habited in Indian fashion.\r\n",

      "Passepartout could not behold without a certain fright these women,\r\n",
      "charged, in groups, with conferring happiness on a single Mormon.  His\r\n",
      "common sense pitied, above all, the husband.  It seemed to him a\r\n",
      "terrible thing to have to guide so many wives at once across the\r\n",
      "vicissitudes of life, and to conduct them, as it were, in a body to the\r\n",
      "Mormon paradise with the prospect of seeing them in the company of the\r\n",
      "glorious Smith, who doubtless was the chief ornament of that delightful\r\n",
      "place, to all eternity.  He felt decidedly repelled from such a\r\n",
      "vocation, and he imagined--perhaps he was mistaken--that the fair ones\r\n",
      "of Salt Lake City cast rather alarming glances on his person.  Happily,\r\n",
      "his stay there was but brief.  At four the party found themselves again\r\n",
      "at the station, took their places in the train, and the whistle sounded\r\n",
      "for starting.  Just at the moment, however, that the locomotive wheels\r\n",
      "began to move, cries of \"Stop! stop!\" were heard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Trains, like time and tide, stop for no one.  The gentleman who uttered\r\n",
      "the cries was evidently a belated Mormon.  He was breathless with\r\n",
      "running.  Happily for him, the station had neither gates nor barriers.\r\n",
      "He rushed along the track, jumped on the rear platform of the train,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout, who had been anxiously watching this amateur gymnast,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "When the Mormon had recovered his breath, Passepartout ventured to ask\r\n",

      "arrive at the great basin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The track up to this time had reached its highest elevation at the\r\n",
      "Great Salt Lake.  From this point it described a long curve, descending\r\n",
      "towards Bitter Creek Valley, to rise again to the dividing ridge of the\r\n",
      "waters between the Atlantic and the Pacific.  There were many creeks in\r\n",
      "this mountainous region, and it was necessary to cross Muddy Creek,\r\n",
      "Green Creek, and others, upon culverts.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout grew more and more impatient as they went on, while Fix\r\n",
      "longed to get out of this difficult region, and was more anxious than\r\n",
      "Phileas Fogg himself to be beyond the danger of delays and accidents,\r\n",
      "and set foot on English soil.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At ten o'clock at night the train stopped at Fort Bridger station, and\r\n",
      "twenty minutes later entered Wyoming Territory, following the valley of\r\n",
      "Bitter Creek throughout.  The next day, 7th December, they stopped for\r\n",
      "a quarter of an hour at Green River station.  Snow had fallen\r\n",
      "abundantly during the night, but, being mixed with rain, it had half\r\n",
      "melted, and did not interrupt their progress.  The bad weather,\r\n",
      "however, annoyed Passepartout; for the accumulation of snow, by\r\n",
      "blocking the wheels of the cars, would certainly have been fatal to Mr.\r\n",
      "Fogg's tour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What an idea!\" he said to himself.  \"Why did my master make this\r\n",
      "journey in winter?  Couldn't he have waited for the good season to\r\n",
      "increase his chances?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While the worthy Frenchman was absorbed in the state of the sky and the\r\n",
      "depression of the temperature, Aouda was experiencing fears from a\r\n",
      "totally different cause.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Several passengers had got off at Green River, and were walking up and\r\n",
      "down the platforms; and among these Aouda recognised Colonel Stamp\r\n",
      "Proctor, the same who had so grossly insulted Phileas Fogg at the San\r\n",
      "Francisco meeting.  Not wishing to be recognised, the young woman drew\r\n",
      "back from the window, feeling much alarm at her discovery.  She was\r\n",
      "attached to the man who, however coldly, gave her daily evidences of\r\n",
      "the most absolute devotion.  She did not comprehend, perhaps, the depth\r\n",
      "of the sentiment with which her protector inspired her, which she\r\n",
      "called gratitude, but which, though she was unconscious of it, was\r\n",
      "really more than that.  Her heart sank within her when she recognised\r\n",
      "the man whom Mr. Fogg desired, sooner or later, to call to account for\r\n",
      "his conduct.  Chance alone, it was clear, had brought Colonel Proctor\r\n",
      "on this train; but there he was, and it was necessary, at all hazards,\r\n",
      "that Phileas Fogg should not perceive his adversary.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Aouda seized a moment when Mr. Fogg was asleep to tell Fix and\r\n",
      "Passepartout whom she had seen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That Proctor on this train!\" cried Fix.  \"Well, reassure yourself,\r\n",
      "madam; before he settles with Mr. Fogg; he has got to deal with me!  It\r\n",
      "seems to me that I was the more insulted of the two.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And, besides,\" added Passepartout, \"I'll take charge of him, colonel\r\n",
      "as he is.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mr. Fix,\" resumed Aouda, \"Mr. Fogg will allow no one to avenge him.\r\n",
      "He said that he would come back to America to find this man.  Should he\r\n",
      "perceive Colonel Proctor, we could not prevent a collision which might\r\n",
      "have terrible results.  He must not see him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You are right, madam,\" replied Fix; \"a meeting between them might ruin\r\n",
      "all.  Whether he were victorious or beaten, Mr. Fogg would be delayed,\r\n",
      "and--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And,\" added Passepartout, \"that would play the game of the gentlemen\r\n",
      "of the Reform Club.  In four days we shall be in New York.  Well, if my\r\n",
      "master does not leave this car during those four days, we may hope that\r\n",
      "chance will not bring him face to face with this confounded American.\r\n",
      "We must, if possible, prevent his stirring out of it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The conversation dropped.  Mr. Fogg had just woke up, and was looking\r\n",
      "out of the window.  Soon after Passepartout, without being heard by his\r\n",
      "master or Aouda, whispered to the detective, \"Would you really fight\r\n",
      "for him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I would do anything,\" replied Fix, in a tone which betrayed determined\r\n",
      "will, \"to get him back living to Europe!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout felt something like a shudder shoot through his frame, but\r\n",
      "his confidence in his master remained unbroken.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Was there any means of detaining Mr. Fogg in the car, to avoid a\r\n",
      "meeting between him and the colonel?  It ought not to be a difficult\r\n",
      "task, since that gentleman was naturally sedentary and little curious.\r\n",
      "The detective, at least, seemed to have found a way; for, after a few\r\n",
      "moments, he said to Mr. Fogg, \"These are long and slow hours, sir, that\r\n",
      "we are passing on the railway.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" replied Mr. Fogg; \"but they pass.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You were in the habit of playing whist,\" resumed Fix, \"on the\r\n",
      "steamers.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes; but it would be difficult to do so here.  I have neither cards\r\n",
      "nor partners.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, but we can easily buy some cards, for they are sold on all the\r\n",
      "American trains.  And as for partners, if madam plays--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Certainly, sir,\" Aouda quickly replied; \"I understand whist.  It is\r\n",
      "part of an English education.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I myself have some pretensions to playing a good game.  Well, here are\r\n",
      "three of us, and a dummy--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"As you please, sir,\" replied Phileas Fogg, heartily glad to resume his\r\n",
      "favourite pastime even on the railway.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout was dispatched in search of the steward, and soon returned\r\n",
      "with two packs of cards, some pins, counters, and a shelf covered with\r\n",
      "cloth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The game commenced.  Aouda understood whist sufficiently well, and even\r\n",
      "received some compliments on her playing from Mr. Fogg.  As for the\r\n",
      "detective, he was simply an adept, and worthy of being matched against\r\n",
      "his present opponent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now,\" thought Passepartout, \"we've got him.  He won't budge.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At eleven in the morning the train had reached the dividing ridge of\r\n",
      "the waters at Bridger Pass, seven thousand five hundred and twenty-four\r\n",
      "feet above the level of the sea, one of the highest points attained by\r\n",
      "the track in crossing the Rocky Mountains.  After going about two\r\n",
      "hundred miles, the travellers at last found themselves on one of those\r\n",
      "vast plains which extend to the Atlantic, and which nature has made so\r\n",
      "propitious for laying the iron road.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the declivity of the Atlantic basin the first streams, branches of\r\n",
      "the North Platte River, already appeared.  The whole northern and\r\n",
      "eastern horizon was bounded by the immense semi-circular curtain which\r\n",
      "is formed by the southern portion of the Rocky Mountains, the highest\r\n",
      "being Laramie Peak.  Between this and the railway extended vast plains,\r\n",
      "plentifully irrigated.  On the right rose the lower spurs of the\r\n",
      "mountainous mass which extends southward to the sources of the Arkansas\r\n",
      "River, one of the great tributaries of the Missouri.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At half-past twelve the travellers caught sight for an instant of Fort\r\n",
      "Halleck, which commands that section; and in a few more hours the Rocky\r\n",
      "Mountains were crossed.  There was reason to hope, then, that no\r\n",
      "accident would mark the journey through this difficult country.  The\r\n",
      "snow had ceased falling, and the air became crisp and cold.  Large\r\n",
      "birds, frightened by the locomotive, rose and flew off in the distance.\r\n",
      "No wild beast appeared on the plain.  It was a desert in its vast\r\n",
      "nakedness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After a comfortable breakfast, served in the car, Mr. Fogg and his\r\n",
      "partners had just resumed whist, when a violent whistling was heard,\r\n",
      "and the train stopped.  Passepartout put his head out of the door, but\r\n",
      "saw nothing to cause the delay; no station was in view.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Aouda and Fix feared that Mr. Fogg might take it into his head to get\r\n",
      "out; but that gentleman contented himself with saying to his servant,\r\n",
      "\"See what is the matter.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout rushed out of the car.  Thirty or forty passengers had\r\n",
      "already descended, amongst them Colonel Stamp Proctor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The train had stopped before a red signal which blocked the way.  The\r\n",
      "engineer and conductor were talking excitedly with a signal-man, whom\r\n",
      "the station-master at Medicine Bow, the next stopping place, had sent\r\n",
      "on before.  The passengers drew around and took part in the discussion,\r\n",
      "in which Colonel Proctor, with his insolent manner, was conspicuous.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout, joining the group, heard the signal-man say, \"No! you\r\n",
      "can't pass.  The bridge at Medicine Bow is shaky, and would not bear\r\n",
      "the weight of the train.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was a suspension-bridge thrown over some rapids, about a mile from\r\n",
      "the place where they now were.  According to the signal-man, it was in\r\n",
      "a ruinous condition, several of the iron wires being broken; and it was\r\n",
      "impossible to risk the passage.  He did not in any way exaggerate the\r\n",
      "condition of the bridge.  It may be taken for granted that, rash as the\r\n",
      "Americans usually are, when they are prudent there is good reason for\r\n",
      "it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout, not daring to apprise his master of what he heard,\r\n",
      "listened with set teeth, immovable as a statue.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hum!\" cried Colonel Proctor; \"but we are not going to stay here, I\r\n",
      "imagine, and take root in the snow?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Colonel,\" replied the conductor, \"we have telegraphed to Omaha for a\r\n",
      "train, but it is not likely that it will reach Medicine Bow in less\r\n",
      "than six hours.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Six hours!\" cried Passepartout.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" returned the conductor, \"besides, it will take us as long\r\n",
      "as that to reach Medicine Bow on foot.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But it is only a mile from here,\" said one of the passengers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, but it's on the other side of the river.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And can't we cross that in a boat?\" asked the colonel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's impossible.  The creek is swelled by the rains.  It is a rapid,\r\n",
      "and we shall have to make a circuit of ten miles to the north to find a\r\n",
      "ford.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The colonel launched a volley of oaths, denouncing the railway company\r\n",
      "and the conductor; and Passepartout, who was furious, was not\r\n",
      "disinclined to make common cause with him.  Here was an obstacle,\r\n",
      "indeed, which all his master's banknotes could not remove.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a general disappointment among the passengers, who, without\r\n",
      "reckoning the delay, saw themselves compelled to trudge fifteen miles\r\n",
      "over a plain covered with snow.  They grumbled and protested, and would\r\n",
      "certainly have thus attracted Phileas Fogg's attention if he had not\r\n",
      "been completely absorbed in his game.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout found that he could not avoid telling his master what had\r\n",
      "occurred, and, with hanging head, he was turning towards the car, when\r\n",
      "the engineer, a true Yankee, named Forster called out, \"Gentlemen,\r\n",
      "perhaps there is a way, after all, to get over.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"On the bridge?\" asked a passenger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"On the bridge.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"With our train?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"With our train.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout stopped short, and eagerly listened to the engineer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But the bridge is unsafe,\" urged the conductor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No matter,\" replied Forster; \"I think that by putting on the very\r\n",
      "highest speed we might have a chance of getting over.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The devil!\" muttered Passepartout.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But a number of the passengers were at once attracted by the engineer's\r\n",
      "proposal, and Colonel Proctor was especially delighted, and found the\r\n",
      "plan a very feasible one.  He told stories about engineers leaping\r\n",
      "their trains over rivers without bridges, by putting on full steam; and\r\n",
      "many of those present avowed themselves of the engineer's mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We have fifty chances out of a hundred of getting over,\" said one.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Eighty! ninety!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout was astounded, and, though ready to attempt anything to\r\n",
      "get over Medicine Creek, thought the experiment proposed a little too\r\n",
      "American.  \"Besides,\" thought he, \"there's a still more simple way, and\r\n",
      "it does not even occur to any of these people!  Sir,\" said he aloud to\r\n",
      "one of the passengers, \"the engineer's plan seems to me a little\r\n",
      "dangerous, but--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Eighty chances!\" replied the passenger, turning his back on him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I know it,\" said Passepartout, turning to another passenger, \"but a\r\n",
      "simple idea--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ideas are no use,\" returned the American, shrugging his shoulders, \"as\r\n",
      "the engineer assures us that we can pass.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Doubtless,\" urged Passepartout, \"we can pass, but perhaps it would be\r\n",
      "more prudent--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What!  Prudent!\" cried Colonel Proctor, whom this word seemed to\r\n",
      "excite prodigiously.  \"At full speed, don't you see, at full speed!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I know--I see,\" repeated Passepartout; \"but it would be, if not more\r\n",
      "prudent, since that word displeases you, at least more natural--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Who!  What!  What's the matter with this fellow?\" cried several.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The poor fellow did not know to whom to address himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Are you afraid?\" asked Colonel Proctor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I afraid?  Very well; I will show these people that a Frenchman can be\r\n",
      "as American as they!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"All aboard!\" cried the conductor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, all aboard!\" repeated Passepartout, and immediately.  \"But they\r\n",
      "can't prevent me from thinking that it would be more natural for us to\r\n",
      "cross the bridge on foot, and let the train come after!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But no one heard this sage reflection, nor would anyone have\r\n",
      "acknowledged its justice.  The passengers resumed their places in the\r\n",
      "cars.  Passepartout took his seat without telling what had passed.  The\r\n",
      "whist-players were quite absorbed in their game.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The locomotive whistled vigorously; the engineer, reversing the steam,\r\n",
      "backed the train for nearly a mile--retiring, like a jumper, in order\r\n",
      "to take a longer leap.  Then, with another whistle, he began to move\r\n",
      "forward; the train increased its speed, and soon its rapidity became\r\n",
      "frightful; a prolonged screech issued from the locomotive; the piston\r\n",
      "worked up and down twenty strokes to the second.  They perceived that\r\n",
      "the whole train, rushing on at the rate of a hundred miles an hour,\r\n",
      "hardly bore upon the rails at all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And they passed over!  It was like a flash.  No one saw the bridge.\r\n",
      "The train leaped, so to speak, from one bank to the other, and the\r\n",
      "engineer could not stop it until it had gone five miles beyond the\r\n",
      "station.  But scarcely had the train passed the river, when the bridge,\r\n",
      "completely ruined, fell with a crash into the rapids of Medicine Bow.\r\n",

      "Mr. Fogg and his partners had resumed their game; no one--not even the\r\n",
      "dummy--complained of the length of the trip.  Fix had begun by winning\r\n",
      "several guineas, which he seemed likely to lose; but he showed himself\r\n",
      "a not less eager whist-player than Mr. Fogg.  During the morning,\r\n",
      "chance distinctly favoured that gentleman.  Trumps and honours were\r\n",
      "showered upon his hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Once, having resolved on a bold stroke, he was on the point of playing\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Fix raised their heads, and beheld Colonel Proctor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stamp Proctor and Phileas Fogg recognised each other at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "going to play a spade!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And who plays it,\" replied Phileas Fogg coolly, throwing down the ten\r\n",
      "of spades.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, it pleases me to have it diamonds,\" replied Colonel Proctor, in\r\n",
      "an insolent tone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He made a movement as if to seize the card which had just been played,\r\n",
      "adding, \"You don't understand anything about whist.\"\r\n",

      "\"You have only to try, son of John Bull,\" replied the colonel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Aouda turned pale, and her blood ran cold.  She seized Mr. Fogg's arm\r\n",
      "and gently pulled him back.  Passepartout was ready to pounce upon the\r\n",
      "American, who was staring insolently at his opponent.  But Fix got up,\r\n",
      "and, going to Colonel Proctor said, \"You forget that it is I with whom\r\n",
      "you have to deal, sir; for it was I whom you not only insulted, but\r\n",
      "struck!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mr. Fix,\" said Mr. Fogg, \"pardon me, but this affair is mine, and mine\r\n",
      "only.  The colonel has again insulted me, by insisting that I should\r\n",
      "not play a spade, and he shall give me satisfaction for it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"When and where you will,\" replied the American, \"and with whatever\r\n",
      "weapon you choose.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Aouda in vain attempted to retain Mr. Fogg; as vainly did the detective\r\n",
      "endeavour to make the quarrel his.  Passepartout wished to throw the\r\n",
      "colonel out of the window, but a sign from his master checked him.\r\n",
      "Phileas Fogg left the car, and the American followed him upon the\r\n",
      "platform.  \"Sir,\" said Mr. Fogg to his adversary, \"I am in a great\r\n",
      "hurry to get back to Europe, and any delay whatever will be greatly to\r\n",
      "my disadvantage.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, what's that to me?\" replied Colonel Proctor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sir,\" said Mr. Fogg, very politely, \"after our meeting at San\r\n",
      "Francisco, I determined to return to America and find you as soon as I\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"All this is an evasion,\" cried Stamp Proctor.  \"Now or never!\"\r\n",

      "\"Very good.  You are going to New York?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"It's the next station.  The train will be there in an hour, and will\r\n",

      "exchanged.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very well,\" said Mr. Fogg.  \"I will stop at Plum Creek.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And I guess you'll stay there too,\" added the American insolently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Who knows?\" replied Mr. Fogg, returning to the car as coolly as usual.\r\n",
      "He began to reassure Aouda, telling her that blusterers were never to\r\n",
      "be feared, and begged Fix to be his second at the approaching duel, a\r\n",
      "request which the detective could not refuse.  Mr. Fogg resumed the\r\n",
      "interrupted game with perfect calmness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At eleven o'clock the locomotive's whistle announced that they were\r\n",
      "approaching Plum Creek station.  Mr. Fogg rose, and, followed by Fix,\r\n",
      "went out upon the platform.  Passepartout accompanied him, carrying a\r\n",
      "pair of revolvers.  Aouda remained in the car, as pale as death.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The door of the next car opened, and Colonel Proctor appeared on the\r\n",
      "platform, attended by a Yankee of his own stamp as his second.  But\r\n",
      "just as the combatants were about to step from the train, the conductor\r\n",
      "hurried up, and shouted, \"You can't get off, gentlemen!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why not?\" asked the colonel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We are twenty minutes late, and we shall not stop.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But I am going to fight a duel with this gentleman.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I am sorry,\" said the conductor; \"but we shall be off at once.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The train started.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm really very sorry, gentlemen,\" said the conductor.  \"Under any\r\n",
      "other circumstances I should have been happy to oblige you.  But, after\r\n",
      "all, as you have not had time to fight here, why not fight as we go\r\n",
      "along?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That wouldn't be convenient, perhaps, for this gentleman,\" said the\r\n",
      "colonel, in a jeering tone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It would be perfectly so,\" replied Phileas Fogg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, we are really in America,\" thought Passepartout, \"and the\r\n",
      "conductor is a gentleman of the first order!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So muttering, he followed his master.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The two combatants, their seconds, and the conductor passed through the\r\n",
      "cars to the rear of the train.  The last car was only occupied by a\r\n",
      "dozen passengers, whom the conductor politely asked if they would not\r\n",
      "be so kind as to leave it vacant for a few moments, as two gentlemen\r\n",
      "had an affair of honour to settle.  The passengers granted the request\r\n",
      "with alacrity, and straightway disappeared on the platform.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The car, which was some fifty feet long, was very convenient for their\r\n",
      "purpose.  The adversaries might march on each other in the aisle, and\r\n",
      "fire at their ease.  Never was duel more easily arranged.  Mr. Fogg and\r\n",
      "Colonel Proctor, each provided with two six-barrelled revolvers,\r\n",
      "entered the car.  The seconds, remaining outside, shut them in.  They\r\n",
      "were to begin firing at the first whistle of the locomotive.  After an\r\n",
      "interval of two minutes, what remained of the two gentlemen would be\r\n",
      "taken from the car.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nothing could be more simple.  Indeed, it was all so simple that Fix\r\n",
      "and Passepartout felt their hearts beating as if they would crack.\r\n",
      "They were listening for the whistle agreed upon, when suddenly savage\r\n",
      "cries resounded in the air, accompanied by reports which certainly did\r\n",
      "not issue from the car where the duellists were.  The reports continued\r\n",
      "in front and the whole length of the train.  Cries of terror proceeded\r\n",
      "from the interior of the cars.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Colonel Proctor and Mr. Fogg, revolvers in hand, hastily quitted their\r\n",
      "prison, and rushed forward where the noise was most clamorous.  They\r\n",
      "then perceived that the train was attacked by a band of Sioux.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was not the first attempt of these daring Indians, for more than\r\n",
      "once they had waylaid trains on the road.  A hundred of them had,\r\n",
      "according to their habit, jumped upon the steps without stopping the\r\n",
      "train, with the ease of a clown mounting a horse at full gallop.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Sioux were armed with guns, from which came the reports, to which\r\n",
      "the passengers, who were almost all armed, responded by revolver-shots.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Indians had first mounted the engine, and half stunned the engineer\r\n",
      "and stoker with blows from their muskets.  A Sioux chief, wishing to\r\n",
      "stop the train, but not knowing how to work the regulator, had opened\r\n",
      "wide instead of closing the steam-valve, and the locomotive was\r\n",
      "plunging forward with terrific velocity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Sioux had at the same time invaded the cars, skipping like enraged\r\n",
      "monkeys over the roofs, thrusting open the doors, and fighting hand to\r\n",
      "hand with the passengers.  Penetrating the baggage-car, they pillaged\r\n",
      "it, throwing the trunks out of the train.  The cries and shots were\r\n",
      "constant.  The travellers defended themselves bravely; some of the cars\r\n",
      "were barricaded, and sustained a siege, like moving forts, carried\r\n",
      "along at a speed of a hundred miles an hour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Aouda behaved courageously from the first.  She defended herself like a\r\n",
      "true heroine with a revolver, which she shot through the broken windows\r\n",
      "whenever a savage made his appearance.  Twenty Sioux had fallen\r\n",
      "mortally wounded to the ground, and the wheels crushed those who fell\r\n",
      "upon the rails as if they had been worms.  Several passengers, shot or\r\n",
      "stunned, lay on the seats.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was necessary to put an end to the struggle, which had lasted for\r\n",
      "ten minutes, and which would result in the triumph of the Sioux if the\r\n",
      "train was not stopped.  Fort Kearney station, where there was a\r\n",
      "garrison, was only two miles distant; but, that once passed, the Sioux\r\n",
      "would be masters of the train between Fort Kearney and the station\r\n",
      "beyond.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The conductor was fighting beside Mr. Fogg, when he was shot and fell.\r\n",
      "At the same moment he cried, \"Unless the train is stopped in five\r\n",
      "minutes, we are lost!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It shall be stopped,\" said Phileas Fogg, preparing to rush from the\r\n",
      "car.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Stay, monsieur,\" cried Passepartout; \"I will go.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Fogg had not time to stop the brave fellow, who, opening a door\r\n",
      "unperceived by the Indians, succeeded in slipping under the car; and\r\n",
      "while the struggle continued and the balls whizzed across each other\r\n",
      "over his head, he made use of his old acrobatic experience, and with\r\n",
      "amazing agility worked his way under the cars, holding on to the\r\n",
      "chains, aiding himself by the brakes and edges of the sashes, creeping\r\n",
      "from one car to another with marvellous skill, and thus gaining the\r\n",
      "forward end of the train.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There, suspended by one hand between the baggage-car and the tender,\r\n",
      "with the other he loosened the safety chains; but, owing to the\r\n",
      "traction, he would never have succeeded in unscrewing the yoking-bar,\r\n",
      "had not a violent concussion jolted this bar out.  The train, now\r\n",
      "detached from the engine, remained a little behind, whilst the\r\n",
      "locomotive rushed forward with increased speed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Carried on by the force already acquired, the train still moved for\r\n",
      "several minutes; but the brakes were worked and at last they stopped,\r\n",
      "less than a hundred feet from Kearney station.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The soldiers of the fort, attracted by the shots, hurried up; the Sioux\r\n",
      "had not expected them, and decamped in a body before the train entirely\r\n",
      "stopped.\r\n",

      "speaking, and he understood her look.  If his servant was a prisoner,\r\n",
      "ought he not to risk everything to rescue him from the Indians?  \"I\r\n",

      "resumed his outward composure.  He now saw the folly of which he had\r\n",
      "been guilty in letting Fogg go alone.  What!  This man, whom he had\r\n",
      "just followed around the world, was permitted now to separate himself\r\n",

      "across the vast white plains; it did not seem impossible that he might\r\n",
      "overtake him.  Footsteps were easily printed on the snow!  But soon,\r\n",
      "under a new sheet, every imprint would be effaced.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fix became discouraged.  He felt a sort of insurmountable longing to\r\n",
      "abandon the game altogether.  He could now leave Fort Kearney station,\r\n",
      "and pursue his journey homeward in peace.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Towards two o'clock in the afternoon, while it was snowing hard, long\r\n",
      "whistles were heard approaching from the east.  A great shadow,\r\n",
      "preceded by a wild light, slowly advanced, appearing still larger\r\n",
      "through the mist, which gave it a fantastic aspect.  No train was\r\n",
      "expected from the east, neither had there been time for the succour\r\n",
      "asked for by telegraph to arrive; the train from Omaha to San Francisco\r\n",
      "was not due till the next day.  The mystery was soon explained.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The locomotive, which was slowly approaching with deafening whistles,\r\n",
      "was that which, having been detached from the train, had continued its\r\n",
      "route with such terrific rapidity, carrying off the unconscious\r\n",
      "engineer and stoker.  It had run several miles, when, the fire becoming\r\n",
      "low for want of fuel, the steam had slackened; and it had finally\r\n",
      "stopped an hour after, some twenty miles beyond Fort Kearney.  Neither\r\n",
      "the engineer nor the stoker was dead, and, after remaining for some\r\n",
      "time in their swoon, had come to themselves.  The train had then\r\n",
      "stopped.  The engineer, when he found himself in the desert, and the\r\n",
      "locomotive without cars, understood what had happened.  He could not\r\n",
      "imagine how the locomotive had become separated from the train; but he\r\n",
      "did not doubt that the train left behind was in distress.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He did not hesitate what to do.  It would be prudent to continue on to\r\n",
      "Omaha, for it would be dangerous to return to the train, which the\r\n",
      "Indians might still be engaged in pillaging.  Nevertheless, he began to\r\n",
      "rebuild the fire in the furnace; the pressure again mounted, and the\r\n",
      "locomotive returned, running backwards to Fort Kearney.  This it was\r\n",
      "which was whistling in the mist.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The travellers were glad to see the locomotive resume its place at the\r\n",
      "head of the train.  They could now continue the journey so terribly\r\n",
      "interrupted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Aouda, on seeing the locomotive come up, hurried out of the station,\r\n",
      "and asked the conductor, \"Are you going to start?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"At once, madam.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But the prisoners, our unfortunate fellow-travellers--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I cannot interrupt the trip,\" replied the conductor.  \"We are already\r\n",
      "three hours behind time.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And when will another train pass here from San Francisco?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To-morrow evening, madam.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To-morrow evening!  But then it will be too late!  We must wait--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It is impossible,\" responded the conductor.  \"If you wish to go,\r\n",
      "please get in.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I will not go,\" said Aouda.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fix had heard this conversation.  A little while before, when there was\r\n",
      "no prospect of proceeding on the journey, he had made up his mind to\r\n",
      "leave Fort Kearney; but now that the train was there, ready to start,\r\n",
      "and he had only to take his seat in the car, an irresistible influence\r\n",
      "held him back.  The station platform burned his feet, and he could not\r\n",
      "stir.  The conflict in his mind again began; anger and failure stifled\r\n",
      "him.  He wished to struggle on to the end.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile the passengers and some of the wounded, among them Colonel\r\n",
      "Proctor, whose injuries were serious, had taken their places in the\r\n",
      "train.  The buzzing of the over-heated boiler was heard, and the steam\r\n",
      "was escaping from the valves.  The engineer whistled, the train\r\n",
      "started, and soon disappeared, mingling its white smoke with the eddies\r\n",
      "of the densely falling snow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The detective had remained behind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Several hours passed.  The weather was dismal, and it was very cold.\r\n",
      "Fix sat motionless on a bench in the station; he might have been\r\n",
      "thought asleep.  Aouda, despite the storm, kept coming out of the\r\n",
      "waiting-room, going to the end of the platform, and peering through the\r\n",
      "tempest of snow, as if to pierce the mist which narrowed the horizon\r\n",
      "around her, and to hear, if possible, some welcome sound.  She heard\r\n",
      "and saw nothing.  Then she would return, chilled through, to issue out\r\n",
      "again after the lapse of a few moments, but always in vain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Evening came, and the little band had not returned.  Where could they\r\n",
      "be?  Had they found the Indians, and were they having a conflict with\r\n",
      "them, or were they still wandering amid the mist?  The commander of the\r\n",
      "fort was anxious, though he tried to conceal his apprehensions.  As\r\n",
      "night approached, the snow fell less plentifully, but it became\r\n",
      "intensely cold.  Absolute silence rested on the plains.  Neither flight\r\n",
      "of bird nor passing of beast troubled the perfect calm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Throughout the night Aouda, full of sad forebodings, her heart stifled\r\n",
      "with anguish, wandered about on the verge of the plains.  Her\r\n",
      "imagination carried her far off, and showed her innumerable dangers.\r\n",
      "What she suffered through the long hours it would be impossible to\r\n",
      "describe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fix remained stationary in the same place, but did not sleep.  Once a\r\n",
      "man approached and spoke to him, and the detective merely replied by\r\n",
      "shaking his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus the night passed.  At dawn, the half-extinguished disc of the sun\r\n",
      "rose above a misty horizon; but it was now possible to recognise\r\n",
      "objects two miles off.  Phileas Fogg and the squad had gone southward;\r\n",
      "in the south all was still vacancy.  It was then seven o'clock.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The captain, who was really alarmed, did not know what course to take.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Should he send another detachment to the rescue of the first?  Should\r\n",
      "he sacrifice more men, with so few chances of saving those already\r\n",
      "sacrificed?  His hesitation did not last long, however.  Calling one of\r\n",
      "his lieutenants, he was on the point of ordering a reconnaissance, when\r\n",
      "gunshots were heard.  Was it a signal?  The soldiers rushed out of the\r\n",
      "fort, and half a mile off they perceived a little band returning in\r\n",
      "good order.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Fogg was marching at their head, and just behind him were\r\n",
      "Passepartout and the other two travellers, rescued from the Sioux.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They had met and fought the Indians ten miles south of Fort Kearney.\r\n",
      "Shortly before the detachment arrived, Passepartout and his companions\r\n",
      "had begun to struggle with their captors, three of whom the Frenchman\r\n",
      "had felled with his fists, when his master and the soldiers hastened up\r\n",
      "to their relief.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All were welcomed with joyful cries.  Phileas Fogg distributed the\r\n",
      "reward he had promised to the soldiers, while Passepartout, not without\r\n",
      "reason, muttered to himself, \"It must certainly be confessed that I\r\n",
      "cost my master dear!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fix, without saying a word, looked at Mr. Fogg, and it would have been\r\n",
      "difficult to analyse the thoughts which struggled within him.  As for\r\n",
      "Aouda, she took her protector's hand and pressed it in her own, too\r\n",
      "much moved to speak.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile, Passepartout was looking about for the train; he thought he\r\n",
      "should find it there, ready to start for Omaha, and he hoped that the\r\n",
      "time lost might be regained.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The train! the train!\" cried he.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Gone,\" replied Fix.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And when does the next train pass here?\" said Phileas Fogg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not till this evening.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah!\" returned the impassible gentleman quietly.\r\n",

      "PHILEAS FOGG\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Phileas Fogg found himself twenty hours behind time.  Passepartout, the\r\n",
      "involuntary cause of this delay, was desperate.  He had ruined his\r\n",
      "master!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this moment the detective approached Mr. Fogg, and, looking him\r\n",
      "intently in the face, said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Seriously, sir, are you in great haste?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Quite seriously.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I have a purpose in asking,\" resumed Fix.  \"Is it absolutely necessary\r\n",
      "that you should be in New York on the 11th, before nine o'clock in the\r\n",
      "evening, the time that the steamer leaves for Liverpool?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It is absolutely necessary.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And, if your journey had not been interrupted by these Indians, you\r\n",
      "would have reached New York on the morning of the 11th?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes; with eleven hours to spare before the steamer left.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good! you are therefore twenty hours behind.  Twelve from twenty\r\n",
      "leaves eight.  You must regain eight hours.  Do you wish to try to do\r\n",
      "so?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"On foot?\" asked Mr. Fogg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No; on a sledge,\" replied Fix.  \"On a sledge with sails.  A man has\r\n",
      "proposed such a method to me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was the man who had spoken to Fix during the night, and whose offer\r\n",
      "he had refused.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Phileas Fogg did not reply at once; but Fix, having pointed out the\r\n",
      "man, who was walking up and down in front of the station, Mr. Fogg went\r\n",
      "up to him.  An instant after, Mr. Fogg and the American, whose name was\r\n",
      "Mudge, entered a hut built just below the fort.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There Mr. Fogg examined a curious vehicle, a kind of frame on two long\r\n",
      "beams, a little raised in front like the runners of a sledge, and upon\r\n",
      "which there was room for five or six persons.  A high mast was fixed on\r\n",
      "the frame, held firmly by metallic lashings, to which was attached a\r\n",
      "large brigantine sail.  This mast held an iron stay upon which to hoist\r\n",
      "a jib-sail.  Behind, a sort of rudder served to guide the vehicle.  It\r\n",
      "was, in short, a sledge rigged like a sloop.  During the winter, when\r\n",
      "the trains are blocked up by the snow, these sledges make extremely\r\n",
      "rapid journeys across the frozen plains from one station to another.\r\n",
      "Provided with more sails than a cutter, and with the wind behind them,\r\n",
      "they slip over the surface of the prairies with a speed equal if not\r\n",
      "superior to that of the express trains.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Fogg readily made a bargain with the owner of this land-craft.  The\r\n",
      "wind was favourable, being fresh, and blowing from the west.  The snow\r\n",
      "had hardened, and Mudge was very confident of being able to transport\r\n",
      "Mr. Fogg in a few hours to Omaha.  Thence the trains eastward run\r\n",
      "frequently to Chicago and New York.  It was not impossible that the\r\n",
      "lost time might yet be recovered; and such an opportunity was not to be\r\n",
      "rejected.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not wishing to expose Aouda to the discomforts of travelling in the\r\n",
      "open air, Mr. Fogg proposed to leave her with Passepartout at Fort\r\n",
      "Kearney, the servant taking upon himself to escort her to Europe by a\r\n",
      "better route and under more favourable conditions.  But Aouda refused\r\n",
      "to separate from Mr. Fogg, and Passepartout was delighted with her\r\n",
      "decision; for nothing could induce him to leave his master while Fix\r\n",
      "was with him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It would be difficult to guess the detective's thoughts.  Was this\r\n",
      "conviction shaken by Phileas Fogg's return, or did he still regard him\r\n",
      "as an exceedingly shrewd rascal, who, his journey round the world\r\n",
      "completed, would think himself absolutely safe in England?  Perhaps\r\n",
      "Fix's opinion of Phileas Fogg was somewhat modified; but he was\r\n",
      "nevertheless resolved to do his duty, and to hasten the return of the\r\n",
      "whole party to England as much as possible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At eight o'clock the sledge was ready to start.  The passengers took\r\n",
      "their places on it, and wrapped themselves up closely in their\r\n",
      "travelling-cloaks.  The two great sails were hoisted, and under the\r\n",
      "pressure of the wind the sledge slid over the hardened snow with a\r\n",
      "velocity of forty miles an hour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The distance between Fort Kearney and Omaha, as the birds fly, is at\r\n",
      "most two hundred miles.  If the wind held good, the distance might be\r\n",
      "traversed in five hours; if no accident happened the sledge might reach\r\n",
      "Omaha by one o'clock.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What a journey!  The travellers, huddled close together, could not\r\n",
      "speak for the cold, intensified by the rapidity at which they were\r\n",
      "going.  The sledge sped on as lightly as a boat over the waves.  When\r\n",
      "the breeze came skimming the earth the sledge seemed to be lifted off\r\n",
      "the ground by its sails.  Mudge, who was at the rudder, kept in a\r\n",
      "straight line, and by a turn of his hand checked the lurches which the\r\n",
      "vehicle had a tendency to make.  All the sails were up, and the jib was\r\n",
      "so arranged as not to screen the brigantine.  A top-mast was hoisted,\r\n",
      "and another jib, held out to the wind, added its force to the other\r\n",
      "sails.  Although the speed could not be exactly estimated, the sledge\r\n",
      "could not be going at less than forty miles an hour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If nothing breaks,\" said Mudge, \"we shall get there!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Fogg had made it for Mudge's interest to reach Omaha within the\r\n",
      "time agreed on, by the offer of a handsome reward.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The prairie, across which the sledge was moving in a straight line, was\r\n",
      "as flat as a sea.  It seemed like a vast frozen lake.  The railroad\r\n",
      "which ran through this section ascended from the south-west to the\r\n",
      "north-west by Great Island, Columbus, an important Nebraska town,\r\n",
      "Schuyler, and Fremont, to Omaha.  It followed throughout the right bank\r\n",
      "of the Platte River.  The sledge, shortening this route, took a chord\r\n",
      "of the arc described by the railway.  Mudge was not afraid of being\r\n",
      "stopped by the Platte River, because it was frozen.  The road, then,\r\n",
      "was quite clear of obstacles, and Phileas Fogg had but two things to\r\n",
      "fear--an accident to the sledge, and a change or calm in the wind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the breeze, far from lessening its force, blew as if to bend the\r\n",
      "mast, which, however, the metallic lashings held firmly.  These\r\n",
      "lashings, like the chords of a stringed instrument, resounded as if\r\n",
      "vibrated by a violin bow.  The sledge slid along in the midst of a\r\n",
      "plaintively intense melody.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Those chords give the fifth and the octave,\" said Mr. Fogg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These were the only words he uttered during the journey.  Aouda, cosily\r\n",
      "packed in furs and cloaks, was sheltered as much as possible from the\r\n",
      "attacks of the freezing wind.  As for Passepartout, his face was as red\r\n",
      "as the sun's disc when it sets in the mist, and he laboriously inhaled\r\n",
      "the biting air.  With his natural buoyancy of spirits, he began to hope\r\n",
      "again.  They would reach New York on the evening, if not on the\r\n",
      "morning, of the 11th, and there was still some chances that it would be\r\n",
      "before the steamer sailed for Liverpool.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout even felt a strong desire to grasp his ally, Fix, by the\r\n",
      "hand.  He remembered that it was the detective who procured the sledge,\r\n",
      "the only means of reaching Omaha in time; but, checked by some\r\n",
      "presentiment, he kept his usual reserve.  One thing, however,\r\n",
      "Passepartout would never forget, and that was the sacrifice which Mr.\r\n",
      "Fogg had made, without hesitation, to rescue him from the Sioux.  Mr.\r\n",
      "Fogg had risked his fortune and his life. No!  His servant would never\r\n",
      "forget that!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While each of the party was absorbed in reflections so different, the\r\n",
      "sledge flew past over the vast carpet of snow.  The creeks it passed\r\n",
      "over were not perceived.  Fields and streams disappeared under the\r\n",
      "uniform whiteness.  The plain was absolutely deserted.  Between the\r\n",
      "Union Pacific road and the branch which unites Kearney with Saint\r\n",
      "Joseph it formed a great uninhabited island.  Neither village, station,\r\n",
      "nor fort appeared.  From time to time they sped by some phantom-like\r\n",
      "tree, whose white skeleton twisted and rattled in the wind.  Sometimes\r\n",
      "flocks of wild birds rose, or bands of gaunt, famished, ferocious\r\n",
      "prairie-wolves ran howling after the sledge.  Passepartout, revolver in\r\n",
      "hand, held himself ready to fire on those which came too near.  Had an\r\n",
      "accident then happened to the sledge, the travellers, attacked by these\r\n",
      "beasts, would have been in the most terrible danger; but it held on its\r\n",
      "even course, soon gained on the wolves, and ere long left the howling\r\n",
      "band at a safe distance behind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "About noon Mudge perceived by certain landmarks that he was crossing\r\n",
      "the Platte River.  He said nothing, but he felt certain that he was now\r\n",
      "within twenty miles of Omaha.  In less than an hour he left the rudder\r\n",
      "and furled his sails, whilst the sledge, carried forward by the great\r\n",
      "impetus the wind had given it, went on half a mile further with its\r\n",
      "sails unspread.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It stopped at last, and Mudge, pointing to a mass of roofs white with\r\n",
      "snow, said: \"We have got there!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Arrived!  Arrived at the station which is in daily communication, by\r\n",
      "numerous trains, with the Atlantic seaboard!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout and Fix jumped off, stretched their stiffened limbs, and\r\n",
      "aided Mr. Fogg and the young woman to descend from the sledge.  Phileas\r\n",
      "Fogg generously rewarded Mudge, whose hand Passepartout warmly grasped,\r\n",
      "and the party directed their steps to the Omaha railway station.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Pacific Railroad proper finds its terminus at this important\r\n",
      "Nebraska town.  Omaha is connected with Chicago by the Chicago and Rock\r\n",
      "Island Railroad, which runs directly east, and passes fifty stations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A train was ready to start when Mr. Fogg and his party reached the\r\n",
      "station, and they only had time to get into the cars.  They had seen\r\n",
      "nothing of Omaha; but Passepartout confessed to himself that this was\r\n",
      "not to be regretted, as they were not travelling to see the sights.\r\n",

      "IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG SHOWS HIMSELF EQUAL TO THE OCCASION\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "An hour after, the Henrietta passed the lighthouse which marks the\r\n",
      "entrance of the Hudson, turned the point of Sandy Hook, and put to sea.\r\n",
      "During the day she skirted Long Island, passed Fire Island, and\r\n",
      "directed her course rapidly eastward.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At noon the next day, a man mounted the bridge to ascertain the\r\n",
      "vessel's position.  It might be thought that this was Captain Speedy.\r\n",
      "Not the least in the world.  It was Phileas Fogg, Esquire.  As for\r\n",
      "Captain Speedy, he was shut up in his cabin under lock and key, and was\r\n",
      "uttering loud cries, which signified an anger at once pardonable and\r\n",
      "excessive.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What had happened was very simple.  Phileas Fogg wished to go to\r\n",
      "Liverpool, but the captain would not carry him there.  Then Phileas\r\n",
      "Fogg had taken passage for Bordeaux, and, during the thirty hours he\r\n",
      "had been on board, had so shrewdly managed with his banknotes that the\r\n",
      "sailors and stokers, who were only an occasional crew, and were not on\r\n",
      "the best terms with the captain, went over to him in a body.  This was\r\n",
      "why Phileas Fogg was in command instead of Captain Speedy; why the\r\n",
      "captain was a prisoner in his cabin; and why, in short, the Henrietta\r\n",
      "was directing her course towards Liverpool.  It was very clear, to see\r\n",
      "Mr. Fogg manage the craft, that he had been a sailor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How the adventure ended will be seen anon.  Aouda was anxious, though\r\n",
      "she said nothing.  As for Passepartout, he thought Mr. Fogg's manoeuvre\r\n",
      "simply glorious.  The captain had said \"between eleven and twelve\r\n",
      "knots,\" and the Henrietta confirmed his prediction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If, then--for there were \"ifs\" still--the sea did not become too\r\n",
      "boisterous, if the wind did not veer round to the east, if no accident\r\n",
      "happened to the boat or its machinery, the Henrietta might cross the\r\n",
      "three thousand miles from New York to Liverpool in the nine days,\r\n",
      "between the 12th and the 21st of December.  It is true that, once\r\n",
      "arrived, the affair on board the Henrietta, added to that of the Bank\r\n",
      "of England, might create more difficulties for Mr. Fogg than he\r\n",
      "imagined or could desire.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "During the first days, they went along smoothly enough.  The sea was\r\n",
      "not very unpropitious, the wind seemed stationary in the north-east,\r\n",
      "the sails were hoisted, and the Henrietta ploughed across the waves\r\n",
      "like a real trans-Atlantic steamer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout was delighted.  His master's last exploit, the\r\n",
      "consequences of which he ignored, enchanted him.  Never had the crew\r\n",
      "seen so jolly and dexterous a fellow.  He formed warm friendships with\r\n",
      "the sailors, and amazed them with his acrobatic feats.  He thought they\r\n",
      "managed the vessel like gentlemen, and that the stokers fired up like\r\n",
      "heroes.  His loquacious good-humour infected everyone.  He had\r\n",
      "forgotten the past, its vexations and delays.  He only thought of the\r\n",
      "end, so nearly accomplished; and sometimes he boiled over with\r\n",
      "impatience, as if heated by the furnaces of the Henrietta.  Often,\r\n",
      "also, the worthy fellow revolved around Fix, looking at him with a\r\n",
      "keen, distrustful eye; but he did not speak to him, for their old\r\n",
      "intimacy no longer existed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fix, it must be confessed, understood nothing of what was going on.\r\n",
      "The conquest of the Henrietta, the bribery of the crew, Fogg managing\r\n",
      "the boat like a skilled seaman, amazed and confused him.  He did not\r\n",
      "know what to think.  For, after all, a man who began by stealing\r\n",
      "fifty-five thousand pounds might end by stealing a vessel; and Fix was\r\n",
      "not unnaturally inclined to conclude that the Henrietta under Fogg's\r\n",
      "command, was not going to Liverpool at all, but to some part of the\r\n",
      "world where the robber, turned into a pirate, would quietly put himself\r\n",
      "in safety.  The conjecture was at least a plausible one, and the\r\n",
      "detective began to seriously regret that he had embarked on the affair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for Captain Speedy, he continued to howl and growl in his cabin; and\r\n",
      "Passepartout, whose duty it was to carry him his meals, courageous as\r\n",
      "he was, took the greatest precautions.  Mr. Fogg did not seem even to\r\n",
      "know that there was a captain on board.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the 13th they passed the edge of the Banks of Newfoundland, a\r\n",
      "dangerous locality; during the winter, especially, there are frequent\r\n",
      "fogs and heavy gales of wind.  Ever since the evening before the\r\n",
      "barometer, suddenly falling, had indicated an approaching change in the\r\n",
      "atmosphere; and during the night the temperature varied, the cold\r\n",
      "became sharper, and the wind veered to the south-east.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was a misfortune.  Mr. Fogg, in order not to deviate from his\r\n",
      "course, furled his sails and increased the force of the steam; but the\r\n",
      "vessel's speed slackened, owing to the state of the sea, the long waves\r\n",
      "of which broke against the stern.  She pitched violently, and this\r\n",
      "retarded her progress.  The breeze little by little swelled into a\r\n",
      "tempest, and it was to be feared that the Henrietta might not be able\r\n",
      "to maintain herself upright on the waves.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout's visage darkened with the skies, and for two days the\r\n",
      "poor fellow experienced constant fright.  But Phileas Fogg was a bold\r\n",
      "mariner, and knew how to maintain headway against the sea; and he kept\r\n",
      "on his course, without even decreasing his steam.  The Henrietta, when\r\n",
      "she could not rise upon the waves, crossed them, swamping her deck, but\r\n",
      "passing safely.  Sometimes the screw rose out of the water, beating its\r\n",
      "protruding end, when a mountain of water raised the stern above the\r\n",
      "waves; but the craft always kept straight ahead.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The wind, however, did not grow as boisterous as might have been\r\n",
      "feared; it was not one of those tempests which burst, and rush on with\r\n",
      "a speed of ninety miles an hour.  It continued fresh, but, unhappily,\r\n",
      "it remained obstinately in the south-east, rendering the sails useless.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The 16th of December was the seventy-fifth day since Phileas Fogg's\r\n",
      "departure from London, and the Henrietta had not yet been seriously\r\n",
      "delayed.  Half of the voyage was almost accomplished, and the worst\r\n",
      "localities had been passed.  In summer, success would have been\r\n",
      "well-nigh certain.  In winter, they were at the mercy of the bad\r\n",
      "season.  Passepartout said nothing; but he cherished hope in secret,\r\n",
      "and comforted himself with the reflection that, if the wind failed\r\n",
      "them, they might still count on the steam.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On this day the engineer came on deck, went up to Mr. Fogg, and began\r\n",
      "to speak earnestly with him.  Without knowing why it was a\r\n",
      "presentiment, perhaps Passepartout became vaguely uneasy.  He would\r\n",
      "have given one of his ears to hear with the other what the engineer was\r\n",
      "saying.  He finally managed to catch a few words, and was sure he heard\r\n",
      "his master say, \"You are certain of what you tell me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Certain, sir,\" replied the engineer.  \"You must remember that, since\r\n",
      "we started, we have kept up hot fires in all our furnaces, and, though\r\n",
      "we had coal enough to go on short steam from New York to Bordeaux, we\r\n",
      "haven't enough to go with all steam from New York to Liverpool.\" \"I\r\n",
      "will consider,\" replied Mr. Fogg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout understood it all; he was seized with mortal anxiety.  The\r\n",
      "coal was giving out!  \"Ah, if my master can get over that,\" muttered\r\n",
      "he, \"he'll be a famous man!\"  He could not help imparting to Fix what\r\n",
      "he had overheard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then you believe that we really are going to Liverpool?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ass!\" replied the detective, shrugging his shoulders and turning on\r\n",
      "his heel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout was on the point of vigorously resenting the epithet, the\r\n",
      "reason of which he could not for the life of him comprehend; but he\r\n",
      "reflected that the unfortunate Fix was probably very much disappointed\r\n",
      "and humiliated in his self-esteem, after having so awkwardly followed a\r\n",
      "false scent around the world, and refrained.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And now what course would Phileas Fogg adopt?  It was difficult to\r\n",
      "imagine.  Nevertheless he seemed to have decided upon one, for that\r\n",
      "evening he sent for the engineer, and said to him, \"Feed all the fires\r\n",
      "until the coal is exhausted.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A few moments after, the funnel of the Henrietta vomited forth torrents\r\n",
      "of smoke.  The vessel continued to proceed with all steam on; but on\r\n",
      "the 18th, the engineer, as he had predicted, announced that the coal\r\n",
      "would give out in the course of the day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do not let the fires go down,\" replied Mr. Fogg.  \"Keep them up to the\r\n",
      "last.  Let the valves be filled.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Towards noon Phileas Fogg, having ascertained their position, called\r\n",
      "Passepartout, and ordered him to go for Captain Speedy.  It was as if\r\n",
      "the honest fellow had been commanded to unchain a tiger.  He went to\r\n",
      "the poop, saying to himself, \"He will be like a madman!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In a few moments, with cries and oaths, a bomb appeared on the\r\n",
      "poop-deck.  The bomb was Captain Speedy.  It was clear that he was on\r\n",
      "the point of bursting.  \"Where are we?\"  were the first words his anger\r\n",
      "permitted him to utter.  Had the poor man been an apoplectic, he could\r\n",
      "never have recovered from his paroxysm of wrath.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where are we?\" he repeated, with purple face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Seven hundred and seven miles from Liverpool,\" replied Mr. Fogg, with\r\n",
      "imperturbable calmness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Pirate!\" cried Captain Speedy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I have sent for you, sir--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Pickaroon!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"--sir,\" continued Mr. Fogg, \"to ask you to sell me your vessel.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No!  By all the devils, no!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But I shall be obliged to burn her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Burn the Henrietta!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes; at least the upper part of her.  The coal has given out.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Burn my vessel!\" cried Captain Speedy, who could scarcely pronounce\r\n",
      "the words.  \"A vessel worth fifty thousand dollars!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Here are sixty thousand,\" replied Phileas Fogg, handing the captain a\r\n",
      "roll of bank-bills.  This had a prodigious effect on Andrew Speedy.  An\r\n",
      "American can scarcely remain unmoved at the sight of sixty thousand\r\n",
      "dollars.  The captain forgot in an instant his anger, his imprisonment,\r\n",
      "and all his grudges against his passenger.  The Henrietta was twenty\r\n",
      "years old; it was a great bargain.  The bomb would not go off after\r\n",
      "all.  Mr. Fogg had taken away the match.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And I shall still have the iron hull,\" said the captain in a softer\r\n",
      "tone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The iron hull and the engine.  Is it agreed?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Agreed.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Andrew Speedy, seizing the banknotes, counted them and consigned\r\n",
      "them to his pocket.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "During this colloquy, Passepartout was as white as a sheet, and Fix\r\n",
      "seemed on the point of having an apoplectic fit.  Nearly twenty\r\n",
      "thousand pounds had been expended, and Fogg left the hull and engine to\r\n",
      "the captain, that is, near the whole value of the craft!  It was true,\r\n",
      "however, that fifty-five thousand pounds had been stolen from the Bank.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Andrew Speedy had pocketed the money, Mr. Fogg said to him, \"Don't\r\n",
      "let this astonish you, sir.  You must know that I shall lose twenty\r\n",
      "thousand pounds, unless I arrive in London by a quarter before nine on\r\n",
      "the evening of the 21st of December.  I missed the steamer at New York,\r\n",
      "and as you refused to take me to Liverpool--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And I did well!\" cried Andrew Speedy; \"for I have gained at least\r\n",
      "forty thousand dollars by it!\"  He added, more sedately, \"Do you know\r\n",
      "one thing, Captain--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Fogg.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Captain Fogg, you've got something of the Yankee about you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And, having paid his passenger what he considered a high compliment, he\r\n",
      "was going away, when Mr. Fogg said, \"The vessel now belongs to me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Certainly, from the keel to the truck of the masts--all the wood, that\r\n",
      "is.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very well.  Have the interior seats, bunks, and frames pulled down,\r\n",
      "and burn them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was necessary to have dry wood to keep the steam up to the adequate\r\n",
      "pressure, and on that day the poop, cabins, bunks, and the spare deck\r\n",
      "were sacrificed.  On the next day, the 19th of December, the masts,\r\n",
      "rafts, and spars were burned; the crew worked lustily, keeping up the\r\n",
      "fires.  Passepartout hewed, cut, and sawed away with all his might.\r\n",
      "There was a perfect rage for demolition.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The railings, fittings, the greater part of the deck, and top sides\r\n",
      "disappeared on the 20th, and the Henrietta was now only a flat hulk.\r\n",
      "But on this day they sighted the Irish coast and Fastnet Light.  By ten\r\n",
      "in the evening they were passing Queenstown.  Phileas Fogg had only\r\n",
      "twenty-four hours more in which to get to London; that length of time\r\n",
      "was necessary to reach Liverpool, with all steam on.  And the steam was\r\n",
      "about to give out altogether!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sir,\" said Captain Speedy, who was now deeply interested in Mr. Fogg's\r\n",
      "project, \"I really commiserate you.  Everything is against you.  We are\r\n",
      "only opposite Queenstown.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah,\" said Mr. Fogg, \"is that place where we see the lights Queenstown?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Can we enter the harbour?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not under three hours.  Only at high tide.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Stay,\" replied Mr. Fogg calmly, without betraying in his features that\r\n",
      "by a supreme inspiration he was about to attempt once more to conquer\r\n",
      "ill-fortune.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Queenstown is the Irish port at which the trans-Atlantic steamers stop\r\n",
      "to put off the mails.  These mails are carried to Dublin by express\r\n",
      "trains always held in readiness to start; from Dublin they are sent on\r\n",
      "to Liverpool by the most rapid boats, and thus gain twelve hours on the\r\n",
      "Atlantic steamers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Phileas Fogg counted on gaining twelve hours in the same way.  Instead\r\n",
      "of arriving at Liverpool the next evening by the Henrietta, he would be\r\n",
      "there by noon, and would therefore have time to reach London before a\r\n",
      "quarter before nine in the evening.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Henrietta entered Queenstown Harbour at one o'clock in the morning,\r\n",
      "it then being high tide; and Phileas Fogg, after being grasped heartily\r\n",
      "by the hand by Captain Speedy, left that gentleman on the levelled hulk\r\n",
      "of his craft, which was still worth half what he had sold it for.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The party went on shore at once.  Fix was greatly tempted to arrest Mr.\r\n",
      "Fogg on the spot; but he did not.  Why?  What struggle was going on\r\n",
      "within him?  Had he changed his mind about \"his man\"?  Did he\r\n",
      "understand that he had made a grave mistake?  He did not, however,\r\n",
      "abandon Mr. Fogg.  They all got upon the train, which was just ready to\r\n",
      "start, at half-past one; at dawn of day they were in Dublin; and they\r\n",
      "lost no time in embarking on a steamer which, disdaining to rise upon\r\n",
      "the waves, invariably cut through them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Phileas Fogg at last disembarked on the Liverpool quay, at twenty\r\n",
      "minutes before twelve, 21st December.  He was only six hours distant\r\n",
      "from London.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But at this moment Fix came up, put his hand upon Mr. Fogg's shoulder,\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "and he was to be transferred to London the next day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout, when he saw his master arrested, would have fallen upon\r\n",
      "Fix had he not been held back by some policemen.  Aouda was\r\n",
      "thunderstruck at the suddenness of an event which she could not\r\n",
      "understand.  Passepartout explained to her how it was that the honest\r\n",
      "and courageous Fogg was arrested as a robber.  The young woman's heart\r\n",
      "revolted against so heinous a charge, and when she saw that she could\r\n",
      "attempt to do nothing to save her protector, she wept bitterly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for Fix, he had arrested Mr. Fogg because it was his duty, whether\r\n",
      "Mr. Fogg were guilty or not.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The thought then struck Passepartout, that he was the cause of this new\r\n",
      "misfortune!  Had he not concealed Fix's errand from his master?  When\r\n",
      "Fix revealed his true character and purpose, why had he not told Mr.\r\n",
      "Fogg?  If the latter had been warned, he would no doubt have given Fix\r\n",
      "proof of his innocence, and satisfied him of his mistake; at least, Fix\r\n",
      "would not have continued his journey at the expense and on the heels of\r\n",
      "his master, only to arrest him the moment he set foot on English soil.\r\n",
      "Passepartout wept till he was blind, and felt like blowing his brains\r\n",
      "out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Aouda and he had remained, despite the cold, under the portico of the\r\n",
      "Custom House.  Neither wished to leave the place; both were anxious to\r\n",
      "see Mr. Fogg again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That gentleman was really ruined, and that at the moment when he was\r\n",
      "about to attain his end.  This arrest was fatal.  Having arrived at\r\n",
      "Liverpool at twenty minutes before twelve on the 21st of December, he\r\n",
      "had till a quarter before nine that evening to reach the Reform Club,\r\n",
      "that is, nine hours and a quarter; the journey from Liverpool to London\r\n",
      "was six hours.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If anyone, at this moment, had entered the Custom House, he would have\r\n",
      "found Mr. Fogg seated, motionless, calm, and without apparent anger,\r\n",
      "upon a wooden bench.  He was not, it is true, resigned; but this last\r\n",
      "blow failed to force him into an outward betrayal of any emotion.  Was\r\n",
      "he being devoured by one of those secret rages, all the more terrible\r\n",
      "because contained, and which only burst forth, with an irresistible\r\n",
      "force, at the last moment?  No one could tell.  There he sat, calmly\r\n",
      "waiting--for what?  Did he still cherish hope?  Did he still believe,\r\n",
      "now that the door of this prison was closed upon him, that he would\r\n",
      "succeed?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However that may have been, Mr. Fogg carefully put his watch upon the\r\n",
      "table, and observed its advancing hands.  Not a word escaped his lips,\r\n",
      "but his look was singularly set and stern.  The situation, in any\r\n",
      "event, was a terrible one, and might be thus stated: if Phileas Fogg\r\n",
      "was honest he was ruined; if he was a knave, he was caught.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Did escape occur to him?  Did he examine to see if there were any\r\n",
      "practicable outlet from his prison?  Did he think of escaping from it?\r\n",
      "Possibly; for once he walked slowly around the room.  But the door was\r\n",
      "locked, and the window heavily barred with iron rods.  He sat down\r\n",
      "again, and drew his journal from his pocket.  On the line where these\r\n",
      "words were written, \"21st December, Saturday, Liverpool,\" he added,\r\n",
      "\"80th day, 11.40 a.m.,\" and waited.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Custom House clock struck one.  Mr. Fogg observed that his watch\r\n",
      "was two hours too fast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Two hours!  Admitting that he was at this moment taking an express\r\n",
      "train, he could reach London and the Reform Club by a quarter before\r\n",
      "nine, p.m.  His forehead slightly wrinkled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At thirty-three minutes past two he heard a singular noise outside,\r\n",
      "then a hasty opening of doors.  Passepartout's voice was audible, and\r\n",
      "immediately after that of Fix.  Phileas Fogg's eyes brightened for an\r\n",
      "instant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The door swung open, and he saw Passepartout, Aouda, and Fix, who\r\n",
      "hurried towards him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fix was out of breath, and his hair was in disorder.  He could not\r\n",
      "speak.  \"Sir,\" he stammered, \"sir--forgive me--most--unfortunate\r\n",
      "resemblance--robber arrested three days ago--you are free!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Phileas Fogg was free!  He walked to the detective, looked him steadily\r\n",
      "in the face, and with the only rapid motion he had ever made in his\r\n",
      "life, or which he ever would make, drew back his arms, and with the\r\n",
      "precision of a machine knocked Fix down.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well hit!\" cried Passepartout, \"Parbleu! that's what you might call a\r\n",
      "good application of English fists!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fix, who found himself on the floor, did not utter a word.  He had only\r\n",
      "received his deserts.  Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout left the\r\n",
      "Custom House without delay, got into a cab, and in a few moments\r\n",
      "descended at the station.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "London.  It was forty minutes past two.  The express train had left\r\n",
      "thirty-five minutes before.  Phileas Fogg then ordered a special train.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were several rapid locomotives on hand; but the railway\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"We shall see,\" replied Aouda, becoming suddenly pensive.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Throughout this day (Sunday) the house in Saville Row was as if\r\n",
      "uninhabited, and Phileas Fogg, for the first time since he had lived in\r\n",
      "that house, did not set out for his club when Westminster clock struck\r\n",
      "half-past eleven.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Why should he present himself at the Reform?  His friends no longer\r\n",
      "expected him there.  As Phileas Fogg had not appeared in the saloon on\r\n",
      "the evening before (Saturday, the 21st of December, at a quarter before\r\n",
      "nine), he had lost his wager.  It was not even necessary that he should\r\n",
      "go to his bankers for the twenty thousand pounds; for his antagonists\r\n",
      "already had his cheque in their hands, and they had only to fill it out\r\n",
      "and send it to the Barings to have the amount transferred to their\r\n",
      "credit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Fogg, therefore, had no reason for going out, and so he remained at\r\n",
      "home.  He shut himself up in his room, and busied himself putting his\r\n",
      "affairs in order.  Passepartout continually ascended and descended the\r\n",
      "stairs.  The hours were long for him. He listened at his master's door,\r\n",
      "and looked through the keyhole, as if he had a perfect right so to do,\r\n",
      "and as if he feared that something terrible might happen at any moment.\r\n",
      "Sometimes he thought of Fix, but no longer in anger.  Fix, like all the\r\n",
      "world, had been mistaken in Phileas Fogg, and had only done his duty in\r\n",
      "tracking and arresting him; while he, Passepartout. . . .  This thought\r\n",
      "haunted him, and he never ceased cursing his miserable folly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Finding himself too wretched to remain alone, he knocked at Aouda's\r\n",
      "door, went into her room, seated himself, without speaking, in a\r\n",
      "corner, and looked ruefully at the young woman. Aouda was still pensive.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "About half-past seven in the evening Mr. Fogg sent to know if Aouda\r\n",
      "would receive him, and in a few moments he found himself alone with her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Phileas Fogg took a chair, and sat down near the fireplace, opposite\r\n",
      "Aouda.  No emotion was visible on his face.  Fogg returned was exactly\r\n",
      "the Fogg who had gone away; there was the same calm, the same\r\n",
      "impassibility.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He sat several minutes without speaking; then, bending his eyes on\r\n",
      "Aouda, \"Madam,\" said he, \"will you pardon me for bringing you to\r\n",
      "England?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I, Mr. Fogg!\" replied Aouda, checking the pulsations of her heart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Please let me finish,\" returned Mr. Fogg.  \"When I decided to bring\r\n",
      "you far away from the country which was so unsafe for you, I was rich,\r\n",
      "and counted on putting a portion of my fortune at your disposal; then\r\n",
      "your existence would have been free and happy.  But now I am ruined.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I know it, Mr. Fogg,\" replied Aouda; \"and I ask you in my turn, will\r\n",
      "you forgive me for having followed you, and--who knows?--for having,\r\n",
      "perhaps, delayed you, and thus contributed to your ruin?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Madam, you could not remain in India, and your safety could only be\r\n",
      "assured by bringing you to such a distance that your persecutors could\r\n",
      "not take you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So, Mr. Fogg,\" resumed Aouda, \"not content with rescuing me from a\r\n",
      "terrible death, you thought yourself bound to secure my comfort in a\r\n",
      "foreign land?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, madam; but circumstances have been against me.  Still, I beg to\r\n",
      "place the little I have left at your service.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But what will become of you, Mr. Fogg?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"As for me, madam,\" replied the gentleman, coldly, \"I have need of\r\n",
      "nothing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But how do you look upon the fate, sir, which awaits you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"As I am in the habit of doing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"At least,\" said Aouda, \"want should not overtake a man like you.  Your\r\n",
      "friends--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I have no friends, madam.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Your relatives--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I have no longer any relatives.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I pity you, then, Mr. Fogg, for solitude is a sad thing, with no heart\r\n",
      "to which to confide your griefs.  They say, though, that misery itself,\r\n",
      "shared by two sympathetic souls, may be borne with patience.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They say so, madam.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mr. Fogg,\" said Aouda, rising and seizing his hand, \"do you wish at\r\n",
      "once a kinswoman and friend?  Will you have me for your wife?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Fogg, at this, rose in his turn.  There was an unwonted light in\r\n",
      "his eyes, and a slight trembling of his lips.  Aouda looked into his\r\n",
      "face.  The sincerity, rectitude, firmness, and sweetness of this soft\r\n",
      "glance of a noble woman, who could dare all to save him to whom she\r\n",
      "owed all, at first astonished, then penetrated him.  He shut his eyes\r\n",
      "for an instant, as if to avoid her look.  When he opened them again, \"I\r\n",
      "love you!\" he said, simply.  \"Yes, by all that is holiest, I love you,\r\n",
      "and I am entirely yours!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah!\" cried Aouda, pressing his hand to her heart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout was summoned and appeared immediately.  Mr. Fogg still\r\n",
      "held Aouda's hand in his own; Passepartout understood, and his big,\r\n",
      "round face became as radiant as the tropical sun at its zenith.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Fogg asked him if it was not too late to notify the Reverend Samuel\r\n",
      "Wilson, of Marylebone parish, that evening.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Passepartout smiled his most genial smile, and said, \"Never too late.\"\r\n",

      "\"Will it be for to-morrow, Monday?\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is time to relate what a change took place in English public opinion\r\n",
      "when it transpired that the real bankrobber, a certain James Strand,\r\n",
      "had been arrested, on the 17th day of December, at Edinburgh.  Three\r\n",
      "days before, Phileas Fogg had been a criminal, who was being\r\n",
      "desperately followed up by the police; now he was an honourable\r\n",
      "gentleman, mathematically pursuing his eccentric journey round the\r\n",
      "world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The papers resumed their discussion about the wager; all those who had\r\n",
      "laid bets, for or against him, revived their interest, as if by magic;\r\n",
      "the \"Phileas Fogg bonds\" again became negotiable, and many new wagers\r\n",
      "were made.  Phileas Fogg's name was once more at a premium on 'Change.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His five friends of the Reform Club passed these three days in a state\r\n",
      "of feverish suspense.  Would Phileas Fogg, whom they had forgotten,\r\n",
      "reappear before their eyes!  Where was he at this moment?  The 17th of\r\n",
      "December, the day of James Strand's arrest, was the seventy-sixth since\r\n",
      "Phileas Fogg's departure, and no news of him had been received.  Was he\r\n",
      "dead?  Had he abandoned the effort, or was he continuing his journey\r\n",

      "Fogg.  Messengers were dispatched to the house in Saville Row morning\r\n",
      "and evening.  No news.  The police were ignorant what had become of the\r\n",
      "detective, Fix, who had so unfortunately followed up a false scent.\r\n",
      "Bets increased, nevertheless, in number and value.  Phileas Fogg, like\r\n",
      "a racehorse, was drawing near his last turning-point.  The bonds were\r\n",
      "quoted, no longer at a hundred below par, but at twenty, at ten, and at\r\n",
      "five; and paralytic old Lord Albemarle bet even in his favour.\r\n",

      "A great crowd was collected in Pall Mall and the neighbouring streets\r\n",
      "on Saturday evening; it seemed like a multitude of brokers permanently\r\n",
      "established around the Reform Club.  Circulation was impeded, and\r\n",
      "everywhere disputes, discussions, and financial transactions were going\r\n",
      "on.  The police had great difficulty in keeping back the crowd, and as\r\n",
      "the hour when Phileas Fogg was due approached, the excitement rose to\r\n",
      "its highest pitch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The five antagonists of Phileas Fogg had met in the great saloon of the\r\n",

      "the engineer, Gauthier Ralph, the director of the Bank of England, and\r\n",
      "Thomas Flanagan, the brewer, one and all waited anxiously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the clock indicated twenty minutes past eight, Andrew Stuart got\r\n",
      "up, saying, \"Gentlemen, in twenty minutes the time agreed upon between\r\n",
      "Mr. Fogg and ourselves will have expired.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What time did the last train arrive from Liverpool?\"  asked Thomas\r\n",
      "Flanagan.\r\n",

      "\"Well, gentlemen,\" resumed Andrew Stuart, \"if Phileas Fogg had come in\r\n",
      "the 7:23 train, he would have got here by this time.  We can,\r\n",
      "therefore, regard the bet as won.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Wait; don't let us be too hasty,\" replied Samuel Fallentin.  \"You know\r\n",
      "that Mr. Fogg is very eccentric.  His punctuality is well known; he\r\n",
      "never arrives too soon, or too late; and I should not be surprised if\r\n",
      "he appeared before us at the last minute.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why,\" said Andrew Stuart nervously, \"if I should see him, I should not\r\n",
      "believe it was he.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The fact is,\" resumed Thomas Flanagan, \"Mr. Fogg's project was\r\n",
      "absurdly foolish.  Whatever his punctuality, he could not prevent the\r\n",
      "delays which were certain to occur; and a delay of only two or three\r\n",
      "days would be fatal to his tour.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Observe, too,\" added John Sullivan, \"that we have received no\r\n",
      "intelligence from him, though there are telegraphic lines all along his\r\n",
      "route.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He has lost, gentleman,\" said Andrew Stuart, \"he has a hundred times\r\n",
      "lost!  You know, besides, that the China the only steamer he could have\r\n",
      "taken from New York to get here in time arrived yesterday.  I have seen\r\n",
      "a list of the passengers, and the name of Phileas Fogg is not among\r\n",
      "them.  Even if we admit that fortune has favoured him, he can scarcely\r\n",
      "have reached America.  I think he will be at least twenty days\r\n",
      "behind-hand, and that Lord Albemarle will lose a cool five thousand.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It is clear,\" replied Gauthier Ralph; \"and we have nothing to do but\r\n",
      "to present Mr. Fogg's cheque at Barings to-morrow.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this moment, the hands of the club clock pointed to twenty minutes\r\n",
      "to nine.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Five minutes more,\" said Andrew Stuart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The five gentlemen looked at each other.  Their anxiety was becoming\r\n",
      "intense; but, not wishing to betray it, they readily assented to Mr.\r\n",
      "Fallentin's proposal of a rubber.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I wouldn't give up my four thousand of the bet,\" said Andrew Stuart,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The clock indicated eighteen minutes to nine.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The players took up their cards, but could not keep their eyes off the\r\n",

      "which Ralph handed to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then there was a moment of silence.  The great saloon was perfectly\r\n",
      "quiet; but the murmurs of the crowd outside were heard, with now and\r\n",
      "then a shrill cry.  The pendulum beat the seconds, which each player\r\n",
      "eagerly counted, as he listened, with mathematical regularity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sixteen minutes to nine!\" said John Sullivan, in a voice which\r\n",
      "betrayed his emotion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One minute more, and the wager would be won.  Andrew Stuart and his\r\n",
      "partners suspended their game.  They left their cards, and counted the\r\n",
      "seconds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the fortieth second, nothing.  At the fiftieth, still nothing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the fifty-fifth, a loud cry was heard in the street, followed by\r\n",

       "' I\\r\\n\\r\\nIN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG AND PASSEPARTOUT ACCEPT EACH OTHER,\\r\\nTHE ONE AS MASTER, THE OTHER AS MAN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Phileas Fogg lived, in 1872, at No. 7, Saville Row, Burlington\\r\\nGardens, the house in which Sheridan died in 1814.  He was one of the\\r\\nmost noticeable members of the Reform Club, though he seemed always to\\r\\navoid attracting attention; an enigmatical personage, about whom little\\r\\nwas known, except that he was a polished man of the world.  People said\\r\\nthat he resembled Byron--at least that his head was Byronic; but he was\\r\\na bearded, tranquil Byron, who might live on a thousand years without\\r\\ngrowing old.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainly an Englishman, it was more doubtful whether Phileas Fogg was\\r\\na Londoner.  He was never seen on \\'Change, nor at the Bank, nor in the\\r\\ncounting-rooms of the \"City\"; no ships ever came into London docks of\\r\\nwhich he was the owner; he had no public employment; he had never been\\r\\nentered at any of the Inns of Court, either at the Temple, or Lincoln\\'s\\r\\nInn, or Gray\\'s Inn; nor had his voice ever resounded in the Court of\\r\\nChancery, or in the Exchequer, or the Queen\\'s Bench, or the\\r\\nEcclesiastical Courts.  He certainly was not a manufacturer; nor was he\\r\\na merchant or a gentleman farmer.  His name was strange to the\\r\\nscientific and learned societies, and he never was known to take part\\r\\nin the sage deliberations of the Royal Institution or the London\\r\\nInstitution, the Artisan\\'s Association, or the Institution of Arts and\\r\\nSciences.  He belonged, in fact, to none of the numerous societies\\r\\nwhich swarm in the English capital, from the Harmonic to that of the\\r\\nEntomologists, founded mainly for the purpose of abolishing pernicious\\r\\ninsects.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhileas Fogg was a member of the Reform, and that was all.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe way in which he got admission to this exclusive club was simple\\r\\nenough.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was recommended by the Barings, with whom he had an open credit.\\r\\nHis cheques were regularly paid at sight from his account current,\\r\\nwhich was always flush.\\r\\n\\r\\nWas Phileas Fogg rich?  Undoubtedly.  But those who knew him best could\\r\\nnot imagine how he had made his fortune, and Mr. Fogg was the last\\r\\nperson to whom to apply for the information.  He was not lavish, nor,\\r\\non the contrary, avaricious; for, whenever he knew that money was\\r\\nneeded for a noble, useful, or benevolent purpose, he supplied it\\r\\nquietly and sometimes anonymously.  He was, in short, the least\\r\\ncommunicative of men.  He talked very little, and seemed all the more\\r\\nmysterious for his taciturn manner.  His daily habits were quite open\\r\\nto observation; but whatever he did was so exactly the same thing that\\r\\nhe had always done before, that the wits of the curious were fairly\\r\\npuzzled.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad he travelled?  It was likely, for no one seemed to know the world\\r\\nmore familiarly; there was no spot so secluded that he did not appear\\r\\nto have an intimate acquaintance with it.  He often corrected, with a\\r\\nfew clear words, the thousand conjectures advanced by members of the\\r\\nclub as to lost and unheard-of travellers, pointing out the true\\r\\nprobabilities, and seeming as if gifted with a sort of second sight, so\\r\\noften did events justify his predictions.  He must have travelled\\r\\neverywhere, at least in the spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was at least certain that Phileas Fogg had not absented himself from\\r\\nLondon for many years.  Those who were honoured by a better\\r\\nacquaintance with him than the rest, declared that nobody could pretend\\r\\nto have ever seen him anywhere else.  His sole pastimes were reading\\r\\nthe papers and playing whist.  He often won at this game, which, as a\\r\\nsilent one, harmonised with his nature; but his winnings never went\\r\\ninto his purse, being reserved as a fund for his charities.  Mr. Fogg\\r\\nplayed, not to win, but for the sake of playing.  The game was in his\\r\\neyes a contest, a struggle with a difficulty, yet a motionless,\\r\\nunwearying struggle, congenial to his tastes.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhileas Fogg was not known to have either wife or children, which may\\r\\nhappen to the most honest people; either relatives or near friends,\\r\\nwhich is certainly more unusual.  He lived alone in his house in\\r\\nSaville Row, whither none penetrated.  A single domestic sufficed to\\r\\nserve him.  He breakfasted and dined at the club, at hours\\r\\nmathematically fixed, in the same room, at the same table, never taking\\r\\nhis meals with other members, much less bringing a guest with him; and\\r\\nwent home at exactly midnight, only to retire at once to bed.  He never\\r\\nused the cosy chambers which the Reform provides for its favoured\\r\\nmembers.  He passed ten hours out of the twenty-four in Saville Row,\\r\\neither in sleeping or making his toilet.  When he chose to take a walk\\r\\nit was with a regular step in the entrance hall with its mosaic\\r\\nflooring, or in the circular gallery with its dome supported by twenty\\r\\nred porphyry Ionic columns, and illumined by blue painted windows.\\r\\nWhen he breakfasted or dined all the resources of the club--its\\r\\nkitchens and pantries, its buttery and dairy--aided to crowd his table\\r\\nwith their most succulent stores; he was served by the gravest waiters,\\r\\nin dress coats, and shoes with swan-skin soles, who proffered the\\r\\nviands in special porcelain, and on the finest linen; club decanters,\\r\\nof a lost mould, contained his sherry, his port, and his\\r\\ncinnamon-spiced claret; while his beverages were refreshingly cooled\\r\\nwith ice, brought at great cost from the American lakes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf to live in this style is to be eccentric, it must be confessed that\\r\\nthere is something good in eccentricity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mansion in Saville Row, though not sumptuous, was exceedingly\\r\\ncomfortable.  The habits of its occupant were such as to demand but\\r\\nlittle from the sole domestic, but Phileas Fogg required him to be\\r\\nalmost superhumanly prompt and regular.  On this very 2nd of October he\\r\\nhad dismissed James Forster, because that luckless youth had brought\\r\\nhim shaving-water at eighty-four degrees Fahrenheit instead of\\r\\neighty-six; and he was awaiting his successor, who was due at the house\\r\\nbetween eleven and half-past.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhileas Fogg was seated squarely in his armchair, his feet close\\r\\ntogether like those of a grenadier on parade, his hands resting on his\\r\\nknees, his body straight, his head erect; he was steadily watching a\\r\\ncomplicated clock which indicated the hours, the minutes, the seconds,\\r\\nthe days, the months, and the years.  At exactly half-past eleven Mr.\\r\\nFogg would, according to his daily habit, quit Saville Row, and repair\\r\\nto the Reform.\\r\\n\\r\\nA rap at this moment sounded on the door of the cosy apartment where\\r\\nPhileas Fogg was seated, and James Forster, the dismissed servant,\\r\\nappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The new servant,\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nA young man of thirty advanced and bowed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a Frenchman, I believe,\" asked Phileas Fogg, \"and your name is\\r\\nJohn?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Jean, if monsieur pleases,\" replied the newcomer, \"Jean Passepartout,\\r\\na surname which has clung to me because I have a natural aptness for\\r\\ngoing out of one business into another.  I believe I\\'m honest,\\r\\nmonsieur, but, to be outspoken, I\\'ve had several trades.  I\\'ve been an\\r\\nitinerant singer, a circus-rider, when I used to vault like Leotard,\\r\\nand dance on a rope like Blondin.  Then I got to be a professor of\\r\\ngymnastics, so as to make better use of my talents; and then I was a\\r\\nsergeant fireman at Paris, and assisted at many a big fire.  But I\\r\\nquitted France five years ago, and, wishing to taste the sweets of\\r\\ndomestic life, took service as a valet here in England.  Finding myself\\r\\nout of place, and hearing that Monsieur Phileas Fogg was the most exact\\r\\nand settled gentleman in the United Kingdom, I have come to monsieur in\\r\\nthe hope of living with him a tranquil life, and forgetting even the\\r\\nname of Passepartout.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Passepartout suits me,\" responded Mr. Fogg.  \"You are well recommended\\r\\nto me; I hear a good report of you.  You know my conditions?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good!  What time is it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Twenty-two minutes after eleven,\" returned Passepartout, drawing an\\r\\nenormous silver watch from the depths of his pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are too slow,\" said Mr. Fogg.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pardon me, monsieur, it is impossible--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are four minutes too slow.  No matter; it\\'s enough to mention the\\r\\nerror.  Now from this moment, twenty-nine minutes after eleven, a.m.,\\r\\nthis Wednesday, 2nd October, you are in my service.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPhileas Fogg got up, took his hat in his left hand, put it on his head\\r\\nwith an automatic motion, and went off without a word.\\r\\n\\r\\nPassepartout heard the street door shut once; it was his new master\\r\\ngoing out.  He heard it shut again; it was his predecessor, James\\r\\nForster, departing in his turn.  Passepartout remained alone in the\\r\\nhouse in Saville Row.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'"
